        "content": "By Rishav Chatterjee(Reuters) -The boards of Thailand-based mobile carriers Advanced Info Service and Thaicom have asked investors to reject offers to acquire the firms under the merger of their respective controlling entities, the companies said on Thursday.In July 2024, power producer Gulf Energy Development, the largest shareholder of Thaicom, and Intouch Holdings, which controls Advanced, announced their intent to merge to create a new company for maximizing benefits for both the firms and improving operations and investments.A merger of Gulf and Intouch, already approved by shareholders of Thai billionaire Sarath Ratanavadi's power company, would create a new entity valued at 1.037 trillion baht ($30 billion).Sarath has a net worth of $15.1 billion according to Forbes and is the country's fifth richest person.Gulf owns about 47.4% stake in Intouch, followed by Singapore Telecommunication (Singtel) which has an around 25% interest.Gulf has a joint venture with Singtel and Advanced to set up data centres locally and is expected to begin operations this year.A tender offer was launched for Advanced, by Gulf Energy, Intouch and Singtel, valuing the firm at 216.30 baht per share, with the offer later being lowered to 211.43 baht.Gulf, in an emailed response to Reuters said its tender offer price was final and it does not intend to revise that.The independent financial adviser's recommendations to reject the offers will not impact the merger process, Gulf added.Advanced said its financial adviser found the revised price to be lower than its estimated valuation range of 229.55 baht to 285.70 baht.Shares of Advanced closed 1.1% higher at 290 baht apiece on Thursday.A Singtel spokesperson told Reuters that the firm does not intend to revise its offer either.\"The announcement by both the companies was expected by the market. The price of both the stocks are higher than the tender offers and so the boards suggested investors to reject the tender offer. This does not post a major risk to the proposed merger,\" said Varorith Chirachon, head of investment research group at SCB Asset Management.As part of the restructuring, a similar tender offer was launched, under which, Gulf Energy, Intouch and Sarath offered to buy 58.9% of Thaicom at 11 baht apiece.Thaicom said its rising stock price since the merger announcement is the primary reason it is asking shareholders to vote against the deal.Its shares ended flat at 12.3 baht on Thursday.($1 = 34.5700 baht)(Reporting by Rishav Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Aaditya Govind Rao; Editing by Mrigank Dhaniwala and David Evans)",

We see benefits from price repair flowing through this quarter and into the next, with stable growth expected.Q: What are your plans regarding CapEx for next year, considering the 5G network build-out?A: There are some delays in CapEx investment this year, but we plan to maintain our guidance. Next year's strategy is not finalized, but if business remains the same, CapEx might decrease.Q: How did the third quarter handset sales perform, and what is the outlook for the fourth quarter?A: Handset sales showed strong performance with high gross margins. We expect continued growth in Q4, especially with high season sales and potential government stimulus packages.Story ContinuesQ: Can you explain the robust net subscriber additions for mobile and broadband services this quarter?A: The improvement is mainly due to reduced churn rather than increased gross additions. For broadband, new subscribers come from both new households and competitors, with a stable churn rate.Q: What is the status of the spectrum auction, and how does it affect AIS's strategy?A: AIS will consider participating in every frequency auction, including 2.1 and 2.3 GHz. The decision will depend on conditions, timing, and pricing. Future auctions for 3.5 GHz and other spectrums are anticipated but not immediate.For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to thefull earnings call transcript.This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

AI technologies will likely facilitate more information processing, leading to an estimated 15% year-on-year growth in data consumption over the next three to five years.Q: Why is the EBITDA growth guidance similar to the revenue growth guidance of 3% to 5%?A: An unidentified company representative noted that the EBITDA growth reflects variable costs that impact the EBITDA line. The depreciation and amortization levels are expected to remain similar year-on-year, aligning EBITDA growth with revenue growth.Story ContinuesQ: What are the implications of acquiring additional spectrum in the upcoming auction?A: Pratthana Leelapanang stated that acquiring additional spectrum, such as 1,800 MHz, would require minimal additional network CapEx due to existing infrastructure. However, acquiring new spectrum bands like TDD would necessitate more investment.Q: Can you elaborate on the changes in prepaid ARPU and the impact of tariff rationalization?A: Pratthana Leelapanang highlighted that the focus on quality customer acquisition and eliminating unsustainable plans has led to an increase in prepaid ARPU. The industry is moving towards more sustainable pricing, which has helped rationalize market offerings.Q: What are the plans for synergy and cost savings between AIS and 3BB?A: Tee Seeumpornroj, CEO of Broadband Business, mentioned ongoing efforts to integrate networks, consolidate shops, and optimize procurement to achieve cost savings. The goal is to have a unified operation by the end of the year or early next year.For the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to thefull earnings call transcript.This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",
