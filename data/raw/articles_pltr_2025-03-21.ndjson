{"article_id": "170457107", "title": "These 2 Stocks Are in Free Fall, and It's Still Too Early to Buy Them", "content": "With Wall Street in the midst of a sell-off, a number of previously market-leading stocks are unsurprisingly trading well below their highs. Two former high-flying tech stocks that have been in free fall recently arePalantir(NASDAQ: PLTR)andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA). Palantir's stock is down by about 37% from its high as of this writing, while Tesla shares have been more than cut in half.Despite their steep declines, though, I still would not be a buyer of either stock at their current levels.PalantirThere are two big reasons why I'd be cautious with Palantir's stock right now: its valuation and the potential impact of reduced government spending.Even after its fall in price, Palantir's valuation is still quite steep. The stock trades at a forwardprice-to-sales (P/S)ratio of over 49 times as of this writing, which is incredibly frothy for a company that grew its revenues by about 36% year over year last quarter. For context, that ratio is more than double the peaksoftware-as-a-service (SaaS)industry multiple from a few years ago when the sector was growing at rates of more than 30%.PLTR PS Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts.In addition, Palantir's revenue growth outlook faces a lot of uncertainty given the federal government's new cost-cutting tactics. Last month, President Trump's Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told the Department of Defense to look for ways to reduce its budget by 8% over the next five years. Palantir cut its teeth as a government contractor, with defense and intelligence agencies making use of its data gathering and analytics platform to aid them in mission-critical tasks such as fighting terrorism. The U.S. government is still its largest customer, accounting for about 42% of its total revenue last year.While there is an argument to be made that Palantir could thrive in this environment, as its solutions help create efficiency, how matters will eventually shake out is unclear. The company has seen some lumpy growth from its U.S. government segment in the past. As such, the new Pentagon budget directives create a risk for the company and its sky-high valuation.That said, Palantir would be an attractive stock to own if one could buy it at the right price. The company's commercial sector growth has been huge since it introduced the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), as it has turned its focus on the application and workflow layers of artificial intelligence (AI) to create an AI operating system for its clients. It has rapidly been gaining new commercial customers through its AI boot camps, which have attracted a lot of new prototype work. It now has a big opportunity to move these clients from proof-of-concept projects to a wider use of real-world applications.Story ContinuesI'd consider dipping a toe into Palantir stock if it were trading in the low $40s. That would give it forward price-to-sales multiple of about 20, based on analysts' revenue projections for 2026. That still wouldn't be a cheap valuation, but this is a stock that one could justify paying a premium for, within reason.Image source: Getty Images.TeslaTesla is another stock I still wouldn't buy, even after its big drop in price.CEO Elon Musk's involvement with President Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has made him an even more polarizing figure than he was before. But Tesla's electric vehicle business had been struggling even before Musk took up his unusual position with the Trump administration. Its automotive revenue fell by 6% in 2024 and 8% in the fourth quarter. Deliveries, meanwhile, were down 1% for the year, but up 2% in Q4. Tesla has been struggling in China -- the largest electric vehicle (EV) market in the world -- due to its aging vehicle line-up and intense competition from Chinese rivals.Musk's government involvement, meanwhile, likely isn't doing Tesla any favors when it comes to selling EVs. In a world divided by politics, Musk's high-profile work for the president is likely alienating close to half of the U.S. population, and probably an even larger percentage of potential customers outside of the U.S.And while tariffs could hurt its rivals more than Tesla, the company is not immune from higher material costs. Rising costs and slowing sales are not a great combination.Tesla bulls, though, will argue that the company is no longer about electric vehicles alone, and that its future will depend more on technologies such as autonomous driving, AI, and robotics. That's all fine -- but Musk has a long history of overpromising when it comes to technological innovations. When I asked Musk's own Grok 3 AI model to make a list of times that Musk had made promises about autonomous driving that did not come true, it quickly produced nine examples, including his prediction in 2015 that Tesla would achieve complete autonomy within three years (2018) and his 2019 assertion that Tesla would have a million robotaxis on the road by the end of 2020. Grok added that Musk has shown a consistent pattern of making ambitious claims about timelines that Tesla then failed to deliver on.It's 2025 and Tesla has still not delivered a system capable of fully autonomous driving, nor does it operate any robotaxis on a paid commercial basis. Meanwhile,Alphabet's Waymo unit has been providing robotaxi rides to paying customers since late 2022.With Tesla's core business struggling and a lot of hope priced into its stock, I'd avoid investing in it.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

{"article_id": "104500098", "title": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) Adoption Rates Appear Low, but This Technology Leader Could See a Massive Surge in Demand in the Next 10 Years. Here's Why.", "content": "The era of artificial intelligence (AI) is undoubtedly upon us. It's still unlikely, however, that you're regularly using a consumer-facing AI tool like Google's Gemini or ChatGPT as anything other than a curious novelty. Such tech is seemingly more suited for the business world.However, businesses aren't all embracing AI solutions yet either. Oh, they know they could. They may even recognize they'll need to dive into AI waters headfirst sooner than later. It's just not entirely clear to most corporate managers how they should proceed, nor is it clear which AI tools are worth investing in.One company arguably stands more ready than any other to capitalize on this swell of demand for AI.The rising AI tideIt's seemingly everywhere, and yet, it's not. Although a majority of adults living in the United States are now regular users of some sort of voice-powered tech, their interest mostly stops there. Only a minority is using generativeartificial intelligence. Trust and usefulness were and are common concerns of would-be users.Usage of AI among institutions is even more anemic. As The Motley Fool's own in-house research arm reports, only 6.8% of businesses located in the U.S. are using AI tools despite the availability of this technology. As the report explains, \"AI use cases are still relatively narrow, and use on a large scale can be complex and expensive.\" The Boston Consulting Group recently quantified the challenge. Of the companies that have adopted some sort of AI tool, 74% are struggling to achieve a return on their investment.We're arguably at a turning point though. Despite a limited profitable purpose thus far, consulting firm McKinsey reports that 92% of enterprises intend to increase their investments in AI over the coming three years. Getting these investments into action won't take nearly that long. The Motley Fool's research shows that business's AI usage rates are likely to grow from less than 7% now to 9.3% just within the next six months, jolting this sliver of the industry into a longer-term growth trend.Indeed, industry research outfit Precedence Research believes this business-oriented piece of the AI market is set to grow at an annualized pace of nearly 16% through 2034. A company calledPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)is poised to capture more than its fair share of this growth.What's Palantir Technologies?Never heard of it? If not, don't sweat it. Plenty of people haven't. Its (relatively) modest market capitalization of $200 billion and lack of consumer-facing products leave it off of most peoples' radars. Investors will want to make a point of putting it on their radars. Palantir represents the future of business-aligned AI. It helps institutions dosomething constructivewith the digital data they've been piling up for years now.Story ContinuesIt's easier said than done. In fact, while corporations and government agencies have been digging through this information for some time now, it's taken true AI-powered platforms to realize the original vision of what could be done with this data. As it turns out, third-party providers are better equipped to offer solutions than the data owners themselves are.And this isn't some merely theoretical idea. Palantir has been earning revenue since 2010 even before AI as we know and understand it today came into existence. Its first contract was with bankJP Morgan Chaseto help the bank identify fraud.What put the technology company on the proverbial map, however, is undoubtedly its partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services beginning in 2020 to help monitor and fight the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. Palantir's' other impressive government contracts include a deal with the U.S. Army to help manage combat situational awareness and provide the U.S. Air Force with an AI-powered mission control platform.It's not just for government agencies. Indeed, the crux of the opportunity ahead is rooted in the private sector where Palantir is already delivering. It's helping oil and gas outfitKinder Morganmore cost-effectively manage its assets, for instance, while it's working withUnited Airlinesto achieve a similar goal. Even fast food chainWendy'sis using Palantir's tech to optimize its supply chain. As the clich\u00e9 goes, the sky's the limit.Wherever that limit is, Palantir seems prepared to test it. Last year's top line of nearly $2.9 billion was up 29% year over year, and the company's calling for revenue growth of 31% this year. Analysts agree, although the analyst community adds that the company could maintain this pace of growth for at least a couple more years beyond this one.Data source: StockAnalysis.com. Chart by author.Although less than 7% of businesses currently utilize this sort of decision-making AI, more than 90% of them intend to invest even more in AI within the next three years. So this projected growth is hardly wishful thinking. The kicker: Palantir Technologies is also profitable, erasing any doubts that this business can at least be viable.Not for the faint of heartThere are legitimate concerns, to be sure. Chief among them is this stock's valuation. Shares are currently priced at nearly 150 times this year's expected earnings. Even though the bottom line is growing, it's a steep climb to a more palatable valuation. Shares may not get there in a straight line.This business also has lots of competition with deep pockets and a low bar to entry. For example,Alphabet,Microsoft, andIBMare not only capable of providing AI tools but are already offering similar solutions.On the flip side, the decision-making AI platform business is one that appears to lend itself to focused specialists like Palantir. The only other pure play in this space is a company calledBigBear.aithat's miles behind market-leading Palantir Technologies. However, the bulk of this industry's growth is still Palantir's to lose.Just don't tarry if you're interested. The stock's 33% pullback from its February peak may not linger for very long.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:TheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

{"article_id": "110000027", "title": "Could Palantir's Stock Plummet Even Further if Elon Musk's DOGE Cuts Spending?", "content": "Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)was one of the hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in 2024 but has seen heavy selling pressure alongside its AI peers so far in 2025. While the prevailing fear driving the markets lower right now is centered around the effects of tariffs and a potential trade war, another initiative also affects government spending: the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), headed by Elon Musk.This initiative has set out to find wasteful government spending and in particularly audited the number of software licenses available versus the number of users actually using the software. While Palantir's software hasn't popped up in any of these reports yet, it's a company to watch because it derives 40% of its revenue from U.S. government-related sources.So, should investors be worried about the stock with a DOGE cut potentially looming?Palantir is dependent on U.S. government spendingPalantir makes AI-powered data analytics software that gives decision-makers the most up-to-date information possible at any given time. And its AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform) allows users to create AI agents that can make decisions on their behalf.The company started off as a provider of software designed specifically for government use. After having success there, it expanded to the commercial side, which opened up a huge opportunity. But the government is still the company's largest and single most important client.In the fourth quarter, revenue rose to $828 million, with $343 million of that coming from the U.S. government. Furthermore, government revenue grew 45% year over year in the quarter, indicating that there is still massive demand for its AI software from that important customer.Considering that DOGE's stated focus is to root out wasteful spending and modernize government infrastructure, Palantir seems like the last place to cut spending. Its AI software is too important to be cut, so I doubt you'll see any weakness from DOGE's efforts. But it may see some pressure in general as President Donald Trump tries to reduce spending. Regardless, I don't think this will greatly affect the company since the AI revolution is ongoing.With the stock down around 40% from its all-time highs, is it worth buying at this price?The stock looks very expensive despite the drawdownAlthough the company looks primed to continue growing rapidly, there are some considerations for investors. Chief among them is valuation: Although the stock sold off heavily, it's still incredibly expensive.Story ContinuesPLTR PS ratiodata byYCharts. PS = price to sales; PE = price to earnings.A price tag of 67 times salesis unbelievably expensive, and it's hard to justify, even with the company's strong growth. And 140 times forward earnings is also very pricey -- I'm not sure Palantir's growth is fast enough to justify it.If it maintain its 36% revenue hike that it had in the fourth quarter over the next five years (Wall Street analysts expect 32% and 26% growth in 2025 and 2026, respectively) with a profit margin of 30%, it would still look overvalued.If both of those five-year projections came true, it would trade at 14 times sales and 46 times forward earnings. Those are more reasonable prices for Palantir, but they would require the stock price not to move from today's level until five years from now. This indicates that there is around five years of growth already baked into the price. So Palantir investors don't have to fear DOGE, they have to fear the market's already high opinion of the stock.As a result, I'm not interested in Palantir Technologies right now sincethere are too many other great bargainsout there that don't have an unreasonable valuation.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

{"article_id": "080600921", "title": "The Unpleasant Truth: The Stock Market Is Still Historically Pricey, Even With the Nasdaq and S&P 500 Recently Falling Into Correction Territory", "content": "Roughly two-and-a-half years ago, the iconicDow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI), widely followedS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and innovation-inspiredNasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC)bottomed out during the 2022 bear market. Much of the ensuing 30-month stretch has featured optimists running the show.But history is quite clear that while the stock market is a phenomenal long-term wealth creator, it doesn't move up in a straight line for extended periods.Over the last four weeks, a level of volatility and uncertainty has returned to Wall Street that hasn't been witnessed in quite some time. Between Feb. 19 and March 13, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite respectively lost 10.1% and 13.7% of their value. This placed both indexes in officialcorrection territory-- i.e., down more than 10% from their highs.While there's no denying that the recent plunge hascreated attractive price dislocations for select stocks, the unpleasant truth is that -- even with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite well off their all-time highs -- the stock market remains historically pricey.Image source: Getty Images.Statistically, this is still a very expensive marketTo state the obvious, value is subjective and in the eye of the beholder. What one investor considers to be pricey might be viewed as a bargain by another.When most investors evaluate the relative cheapness or priciness of a stock or the broader market, they typically do so by using the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. This time-tested valuation tool is arrived at by dividing a company's share price by its trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS). It's a quick method for evaluating mature businesses and major stock indexes, but it can be easily tripped up by shock events.One of the best ways to measure where Wall Street's most widely followed stock index (S&P 500) lands on the valuation scale is by examining the S&P 500's Shiller P/E Ratio, which is also known as the cyclically adjusted P/E Ratio, or CAPE Ratio.The Shiller P/E accounts for average inflation-adjusted EPS over the last 10 years. Accounting for a decade of EPS history, rather than just the trailing-12-months with the traditional P/E ratio, ensures that shock events and recessions can't skew the reading. In other words, it provides the closest thing to an apples-to-apples valuation measure you'll get on Wall Street.S&P 500 Shiller CAPE Ratiodata byYCharts.In December 2024, the S&P 500's Shiller P/E Ratio closed at 38.89, which is the peak for the current bull market cycle, and the third-highest reading during a continuous bull market in history. When the benchmark index officially entered correction territory on March 13, the Shiller P/E closed at 34.47.Story ContinuesTo put these figures into context, the average Shiller P/E for the S&P 500 when back-tested 154 years is 17.22. At its recent low point of 34.47, it was still double the average multiple since January 1871.The historic correlation that investors would be wise to pay close attention to is how stocks have behaved when previously surpassing a Shiller P/E reading of 30. Including the present, there have only been a half-dozen instances in 154 years where this has occurred -- and the previous five wereeventuallyfollowed by declines of at least 20% in the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and/or Nasdaq Composite.History has pretty clearly demonstrated that premium valuations aren't tolerated over long periods. Even the most-expensive markets witnessed the Shiller P/E retrace to the mid-20 range. Over the last three decades, bear market declines have pushed the S&P 500's Shiller P/E down to an average of 22.What these historic correlations point to is the unpleasant truth that the stock market is still historically pricey, even with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite declining by a double-digit percentage.Image source: Getty Images.Companies with premium valuations are most at-risk, while dividend stocks can thriveTo qualify the previous discussion, keep in mind that your investment horizon plays a big role in defining just how cheap or pricey a stock or the broader market is to you. While stock market corrections and bear markets can be jarring and play on investors' emotions, they typically resolve rather quickly. The simple fact that the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite increase in value over long periods often makes it more palatable for long-term investors to deal with historically pricey valuations.Nevertheless, stocks that trade at decisive premiums to their industry or historic norms are typically those that take it on the chin during stock market corrections.For example, artificial intelligence (AI) giantPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)has been the hottest thing since sliced bread over the last two years. Its AI-inspired cloud-based Gotham platform, which assists federal governments with collecting data and planning/executing military missions, is unique and not duplicable at scale. This operating segment is what's helped Palantir sustain 20%-plus sales growth and push to recurring profitability well ahead of expectations.PLTR PS Ratiodata byYCharts. PS ratio = price-to-sales ratio.But on Feb. 19, when the S&P 500 hit its all-time closing high, Palantir stock came with a stone's throw of a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 100! To offer context on just how far outside of historic norms this is,Microsoft,Cisco Systems, andNvidiaall peaked at P/S ratios in the neighborhood of 30 to 40.Palantir is one of many examples in the high-growth tech sector of companies with premium valuations that could be hit hard if the S&P 500 and Nasdaq stock market corrections steepen.On the other end of the spectrum, investors typically seek out perceived-to-be safe stocks during periods of stock market turbulence. While there's no one-size-fits-all blueprint, safe stocks are often time-tested, recurringly profitable, and they usually pay a dividend.The reason dividend stocks become so attractive during corrections is because of their historic long-term outperformance. InThe Power of Dividends: Past, Present, and Future, the analysts at Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks crushed non-payers in the return column -- 9.17% annualized vs. 4.27% annualized -- over a half-century (1973-2023).PMdata byYCharts. Returns from Feb. 19-March 14.For instance, tobacco stocksPhilip Morris International(NYSE: PM)andAltria Group(NYSE: MO)haven't missed a beat since the stock market downturn began four weeks ago. Philip Morris stock is up more than 10%, while Altria Group has eked out a 1.4% gain.Even though tobacco stocks aren't the growth story they were decades ago, they offer predictability during a period of uncertainty on Wall Street. Cigarette smokers have demonstrated a willingness to absorb price increases, and the addictive nature of nicotine, which is found in tobacco, keeps consumers loyal. Philip Morris International and Altria Group aren't going to knock investors' socks off like tech stocks have over the prior two years, but they're just the type companies that can thrive amid a pricey market that's vacillating right around correction territory.Should you invest $1,000 in S&P 500 Index right now?Before you buy stock in S&P 500 Index, consider this:TheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 and S&P 500 Index wasn\u2019t one of them.

{"article_id": "220000211", "title": "2 Crashing AI Stocks That Aren't Worth Buying on the Dip", "content": "Three years after the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, the generative AI hype cycle is getting long in the tooth as investors grow impatient with the lack of value being created on the software side of the industry.Artificial intelligence (AI)-related tech companies likePalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR) andTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) are now struggling to justify their optimistic valuations. They also face the unraveling of political hype, which boosted their stocks after Trump's election victory in November. Let's discuss some reasons why these stocks aren't worth buying on the dip.1. Palantir TechnologiesPalantir's bull thesis is losing steam, with shares down 36% \u2014 at the time of this writing \u2014 from their all-time high of $125 reached in mid-February. The company's shares boomed after it integrated AIlarge language models(LLMs) into its data analytics platforms, while Trump's election victory generated additional hype. However, both catalysts are turning into disappointments.While Palantir's co-founder Peter Thiel is a public backer of Trump and his vice president, JD Vance, it is unclear how this will lead to tangible benefits for Palantir. On the contrary, some of the new administration's goals (such as reducing the Pentagon budget by 8% annually) could actually shrink the market for Palantir's services. Government clients made up around 42% of its revenue in full-year 2024.Palantir's AI pivot is also not as transformational as the market seemed to expect. While company sales grew 47% in 2020 (two years before OpenAI's ChatGPT brought generative AI to the mainstream), its growth rate has fallen to just 29% in 2024. While this isn't a horrible growth rate, it doesn't justify the company'sprice-to-earnings(P/E) multiple of 419.The company's profitability is also under pressure from massive stock-based compensation expenses, which totaled $281.8 million in the fourth quarter. That's 74% of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).2. TeslaLike Palantir, Tesla's stock price has boomed in response to generative AI and Trump's election victory. However, while Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, plays a role in the new administration, investors may have underestimated the negative impact political involvement is having on his company.According to analysts atJPMorgan, Tesla has experienced unprecedented reputational damage. And this trend is having a noticeable impact on sales, especially in European countries like Germany, where February sales plunged 76% compared to the prior-year period (to 1,429 vehicles sold).Story ContinuesThat said, if there is any silver lining to the situation, individual European countries are not that important to Tesla's overall business. And Musk could use his political influence to ease tensions in the world's largest EV market, China, where potential anti-U.S. sentiment could have a much more significant impact on operational performance. In 2024, Tesla sold more than 657,000 units in China. And Musk will need to shore up this business in the face of rising competition from domestic rivals.Image source: Getty Images.With a P/E multiple of 118, Tesla's valuation seems too high, considering its slowing sales, reputational damage, and other challenges in its international markets. A pivot to AI and self-driving cars could eventually help the company diversify outside the automotive industry.

{"article_id": "133000918", "title": "2 Incredible AI Defense Stocks Worth Buying and Holding Forever", "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed from a behind-the-scenes technology to an essential part of our daily experience. While earlier AI milestones -- like DeepMind's AlphaGo victory over the world Go champion in 2016 -- created temporary public interest, they didn't fundamentally change how most people interacted with technology.The emergence of generative AI has changed this dynamic completely. Tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and image generators like Stable Diffusion have made AI's capabilities immediately accessible and visibly impressive to everyday users. These technologies produce sophisticated outputs and tackle problems that were once considered exclusively within human capability.Image source: Getty Images.This technological evolution represents more than just scientific progress. According to McKinsey & Co., generative AI could generate between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion in annual economic value across numerous industries in the decades ahead.For investors seeking to capitalize on this transformative trend, two AI-powereddefense stocksstand out for their exceptional growth potential. Read on to find out more about these ultra-high-growthAI stocks.A leader in national securityBigBear.ai(NYSE: BBAI)stands out in the defense and security sector with its deep domain expertise in AI-powered decision intelligence. In March 2024, the company expanded its capabilities by acquiring Pangiam, a leader in vision AI, which strengthened its portfolio in facial recognition, anomaly detection, and biometrics -- key technologies for modern security operations.BigBear.ai's strategic edge lies in its high-caliber leadership and close ties to the U.S. military.

Furthermore, the 2023 launch of its Artificial Intelligence Platform added a critical layer to its offerings by enabling non-technical users to harness large language models and fully leverage Palantir's technology.Thanks to its potent business model, Palantir continues to solidify its presence in both government and commercial sectors. Specifically, U.S. government revenue grew by a robust 45% year over year to $343 million in Q4 2024, while the company's innovative boot-camp-style sales approach helped to drive a whopping 73% increase in U.S. commercial customers over the past year.CEO Alexander Karp declared in the company's latest quarterly press release that \"a software juggernaut has indeed emerged.\" Thus, Palantir appears uniquely positioned to capture significant economic value downstream for software companies that enable AI-driven productivity gains in enterprises. Its robust financial performance and favorable strategic positioning underscore its potential as a compelling lifelong investment opportunity.Two AI stocks worth buying and holding long termFor investors seeking long-term stakes in the AI revolution, BigBear.ai and Palantir Technologies deliver a healthy dose of value and growth potential. Their specialized focus, proven execution, and expanding market opportunities make these stocks quintessential buy-and-hold candidates in an increasingly AI-driven global economy. As AI becomes ever more integral to defense and enterprise operations, these companies' robust strategies and innovative capabilities position them to benefit immensely from this paradigm shift.Should you invest $1,000 in BigBear.ai right now?Before you buy stock in BigBear.ai, consider this:TheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 and BigBear.ai wasn\u2019t one of them.

{"article_id": "190000842", "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Palantir Technologies vs. Microsoft", "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to change just about every industry under the sun, and businesses are spending heavily to stay ahead of the curb. AI-powered software can automate simple tasks while making knowledge workers more efficient and productive in their jobs. It can also help decision-makers combine relevant data points to make better decisions at a faster pace.The enterprise AI software market is expected to grow from $98 billion in 2024 to $391 billion by 2030, according to ABI Research. Generative AI solutions, like AI agents, will grow even faster. Two companies stand at the forefront of AI-powered enterprise software:Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)andMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).Both stocks have soared amid the current bull market, but therecent pullback may be a buying opportunityfor one of them. Here's the better artificial intelligence stock right now.Image source: Getty Images.Palantir: Accelerating growth thanks to its new AI PlatformPalantir makes software that aggregates data from across an enterprise's operations and derives actionable insights for its users. The introduction of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) made it easier for anyone to start working with its data analysis software through natural language thanks to the power oflarge language models. That drove an acceleration in Palantir's results over the last two years.Palantir saw revenue grow 29% year over year in 2024 while its adjusted operating margin expanded to 39% from 28% in the prior year. The fourth quarter saw it produce even better results for both revenue growth (36%) and profitability (45% margin). Management's outlook for 2025 suggests revenue growth of 31% and adjusted operating margin expanding to 42%.Palantir benefits significantly from scale as a software company with minimal marginal costs. CEO Alex Karp takes a product-first approach to building the business, focusing on making an excellent product for a few select clients with deep pockets. As the product improves and it adds more features, it becomes more appealing to a broader group of businesses. AIP has been key to expanding its usefulness for more businesses.Palantir has two key segments: government and commercial. It started by working exclusively on challenges facing the U.S. military, and its government platform still accounts for the majority of its revenue. Government contracts are generally very sticky, which ensures a solid base of revenue for Palantir.That said, Palantir could face headwinds amid growing geopolitical tensions and as the U.S. government looks to cut back spending. As does the rest of the federal government, the Pentagon currently faces steep budget cuts, which could negatively impact Palantir's largest source of revenue. On the other hand, some believe the budget cuts could benefit Palantir, as it makes workers more efficient and effective, increasing the need for its software if the military reduces staff.Story ContinuesAmid the political tensions, Palantir looks to highlight its success outside of government contracts. Its AIPCon featured a slew of new commercial clients from around the world. As commercial clients grow, Palantir should be able to continue producing strong revenue growth and expanding its operating margin.The big problem with Palantir stock, though, is its valuation. Even after the recent sell-off, shares trade for over 70 times its 2024 revenue as of this writing. If you use management's 2025 outlook, the price is 55 times its projected sales for the current year. Only a handful of stocks have traded at such a massive multiple. And history didn't side with buying them at prices comparable to Palantir's.Microsoft: An AI leader on two frontsMicrosoft catapulted itself to the forefront of the AI discussion when it added $10 billion to its investment in OpenAI in early 2023. Since then, it's become a leader on two fronts of the growing artificial intelligence market: cloud computing and enterprise software.Microsoft's cloud computing platform, Azure, saw substantial growth over the last two years as businesses look to access compute and foundational models on the cloud to develop new AI solutions for their businesses or new AI-powered products for their customers. Management said AI services revenue on Azure grew 157% year over year in its most recent quarter, contributing to 31% overall growth in the cloud computing segment.Management also said demand for AI services exceeded its capacity, indicating that it could grow even faster in the future. And Microsoft is certainly investing to take advantage of the opportunity. It will invest $80 billion on capital expenditures this year, mostly on AI data centers. That growing spend will support both the growing demand of its Azure cloud platform and Microsoft's own AI development.To that end, Microsoft developed its line of AI assistants, dubbed Copilot, for use across its various software platforms, including Github, Microsoft 365, and Dynamics 365. It also offers a stand-alone Copilot app. Businesses can also use Microsoft's Copilot Studio to harness their own data and create their own AI agents to help them automate tasks and surface useful insights for workers. Early adoption of Copilot led to growing revenue and expanding margins for Microsoft's Productivity and Business Processes segment.Microsoft might not be growing as quickly as Palantir, but its stock also trades for a much more reasonable valuation for the substantial growth it does provide investors. You can currently buy the stock for less than 11 times its trailing sales. Looking at its earnings potential, shares trade for roughly 29 times analyst estimates for earnings per share over the next year. Neither is particularly cheap, but those valuations are below its average multiple since the start of 2021. A company with leadership in AI on two fronts certainly deserves a premium, and the current price is attractive for what you get.Microsoft looks like a much better buy than Palantir stock after the recent sell-off in both.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(PLTR) the Best Multibagger Stock to Buy in 2025?", "content": "We recently published a list of12 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other best multibagger stocks to buy in 2025.In the world of investing, the term \u201cmultibagger\u201d refers to stocks that have the potential to deliver returns several times greater than the original investment. One key factor that can help identify potential multibaggers is momentum. Momentum investing focuses on capitalizing on the continuation of existing market trends. Investors using this strategy look for stocks that are experiencing upward price movements, often driven by strong earnings reports, positive news, industry tailwinds, or overall market sentiment. The idea is simple: \u201cthe trend is your friend,\u201d and momentum can be a powerful force in identifying winners before they peak. The importance of momentum has been recognized by famous investors, but many of them emphasized the idea that it is crucial to catch momentum stocks early on. As Warren Buffett put it \u2013 \u201cWhat the wise do in the beginning, fools do in the end\u201d.READ ALSO:12 Best Multibagger Penny Stocks to Buy NowThe US market is close to entering a correction mode as the absolute magnitude of decline since the mid-February peak is approaching 10%. The current policies of the new US administration, such as tariffs, federal jobs cuts and cuts in some large-scale public projects, are causing havoc among investors as many are fearing a scenario in which the US economy enters stagflation \u2013 a period of high inflation among weak economic growth and unemployment. Some analysts have pointed out that sectors reliant on government contracts, such as infrastructure and defense, are already experiencing heightened volatility as a result of these policy shifts. In a recent interview with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News, the President himself refused to rule out a recession in the current year and claimed that the economy is in \u201ca period of transition\u201d and that tariffs might fuel inflation at some point. With consumer confidence showing early signs of weakening, as signaled by recent business surveys, some economists argue that the Federal Reserve may be forced to intervene sooner than expected to stabilize the markets. This idea was already supported by the President, who at some point expressed the opinion that interest rates in the US economy are higher than they should be.The aforementioned developments have caused a market selloff, particularly in previously high-momentum stocks such as the Magnificent 8, which have benefited from the AI megatrend and were responsible for most of the market returns last year. Prior to that, many previously well-performing stocks, such as government contractors, had already lost their momentum following the election results, while some of the few well-performing healthcare stocks were hit by Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement threats. Likewise, the energy sector remained somewhat out of favor \u2013 despite volume tailwinds from Trump 2.0, the expectation of lower oil prices amid a weaker economy has put downward pressure on stock prices in the sector. The key takeaway for investors is that one should look for multibaggers that haven\u2019t yet lost their momentum during the market dip in the last month. These are often lower-capitalization companies that are underfollowed by analysts and operate in high-growth markets.Story ContinuesOur MethodologyTo compile our list of multibagger stocks, we used Finviz to filter the companies that have delivered at least 200% stock price return in the last twelve months.

{"article_id": "080500964", "title": "Should You Forget Palantir and Buy These 2 Millionaire-Maker Stocks Instead?", "content": "Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)has been one of the hottest stocks on the market in the past couple of years, rising an incredible 1,000% as of this writing and beating theS&P 500index's gains of just 45% during this period by a heavy margin.The software specialist's stunning rally can be attributed to the terrific demand for its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which enables customers to embedgenerative AIcapabilities into their operations. The demand for Palantir's AIP has been so strong that the company'sgrowth accelerated impressively in 2024.Even better, Palantir's impressive growth seems here to stay as the increasing size of the company's contracts, the rapid improvement in its customer base, and the expansion of its business at existing customers should ensure healthy top- and bottom-line growth for a long time.However, there is one big problem with Palantir right now: the valuation. The stock has gotten ahead of itself as it is now trading at a whopping 72 times sales and 443 times earnings.Though Palantir may be able to justify its expensive valuation in the long run thanks to the huge opportunity in the generative AI software market, it may be a good idea for investors to look at other options that are trading at attractive valuations and have the potential to make them richer.Let's take a closer look at two other names that are way cheaper than Palantir and could fit into a diversified selection of stocks for investors looking to construct a million-dollar portfolio.1. NvidiaSemiconductor giantNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)has made investors millionaires in the past. For instance, a $5,000 investment made in Nvidia a decade ago is now worth just over a million dollars. Of course, expecting Nvidia to replicate such remarkable gains over the next decade isn't logical considering that it now has a market cap of just under $3 trillion, but it could still deliver robust gains and seems a worthy candidate for a million-dollar portfolio.NVDAdata byYChartsThat's because Nvidia has several solid growth drivers that could pave the way for remarkable growth in revenue and earnings in the long run. From AI to gaming to automotive to digital twins, Nvidia can rely on multiple billion-dollar end markets to sustain its impressive growth.Starting with AI, the company's dominant position in the market for data center graphics cards and its growing influence in the enterprise software market has the potential to add billions of dollars to its revenue. The semiconductor bellwether reported a record $115 billion in data center revenue in the recently concluded fiscal year 2025, which was a 142% increase over the prior year.Story ContinuesConsidering that demand for chips deployed in high-performance computing (HPC), data centers, and AI servers could hit $581 billion in 2035, Nvidia still has a lot of room for growth in this market. Importantly, Nvidia controls the lion's share of the AI chip market, which saw total data center GPU sales of $125 billion last year.Nvidia's key competitors have been unable to make much of a dent in AI chips. Of course, there is a rising threat from the likes ofBroadcom, which makes custom AI processors. But investors should note that GPUs are the chip of choice when it comes to accelerating AI workloads in a data center, with an estimated market share of 60% of the overall AI accelerator market in 2024.At the same time, Nvidia's focus on selling complete AI server systems equipped with multiple chips that include both GPUs and CPUs could help the company maintain its impressive share of this huge end market. That's because an integrated system will enable customers to process workloads faster while reducing energy costs.Not surprisingly, the demand for the company's latest generation of Blackwell systems has ramped up at an incredible pace, and Nvidia sold $11 billion of these chips in the previous quarter. That was more than doubleAMD's total data center GPU revenue in 2024.On the other hand, Nvidia continues to maintain its dominance in the gaming GPU market with a share of 90%. This space is expected to generate a whopping $145 billion in revenue in 2035, suggesting that Nvidia's gaming revenue could increase substantially from the previous fiscal year's level of $11 billion.Throw in other potentially lucrative opportunities such as digital twins and the sharp spike that's expected in the automotive business, and it can be concluded that Nvidia is built for impressive long-term growth.What's more, Nvidia trades at just 27 times forward earnings, a massive discount to Palantir's forward earnings multiple of 145. This makes buying Nvidia a no-brainer right now. It could easily fit into a potentially multibillion-dollar portfolio thanks to its attractive valuation and massive growth opportunities.2. C3.aiEnterprise AI software providerC3.ai(NYSE: AI)has dropped significantly on the stock market since going public in December 2020, losing 76% of its value as of this writing, but it could turn out to be a terrific long-term bet. Like Palantir, C3.ai offers generative AI applications and a development platform that can integrate AI into businesses.The company's growth started picking up in the past couple of years.AI Revenue (TTM)data byYChartsC3.ai's offerings have been gaining traction not just among commercial customers, but among government establishments as well. This was evident from management's comments on the company's February earnings conference call. C3.ai's generative AI solutions are available on major cloud computing platforms, leading to strong growth in the adoption of its software.For instance, C3.ai witnessed a healthy 72% year-over-year increase in the number of agreements it struck in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended on Jan. 31). The company reported a 26% increase in quarterly revenue to $99 million, and there is a good chance that it will be able to deliver stronger growth in the future thanks the number of agreements it has been striking.Moreover, C3.ai points out that several of its customers -- both commercial and government -- are entering into \"new and expanded agreements,\" suggesting that it is also winning more business from its existing client base. As such, it is easy to see why analysts have raised their revenue expectations of C3.ai for the next couple of fiscal years.AI Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Yeardata byYChartsThe company's fiscal 2025 guidance suggests that its top line could jump around 25% to $389 million at the midpoint. However, stronger growth cannot be ruled out over the next couple of fiscal years as C3.ai believes that it can step on the gas by winning a bigger share of the massive AI software market.Investors should note that the global AI software market is expected to jump fourfold between 2023 and 2030, generating $391 billion in annual revenue by the end of the decade.C3.ai, therefore, could sustain impressive growth in its top and bottom lines for a long time to come. Given that C3.ai is currently trading at just over 7 times sales, it is 10 times cheaper than Palantir in price-to-sales ratio. Now looks like a good time to buy C3.ai stock as its ability to deliver solid growth in the long run, along with its attractive valuation, make it another good fit for investors looking to construct a million-dollar portfolio.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

{"article_id": "110000706", "title": "Down More Than 30% From Its 52-Week High, Is Palantir Technologies Stock a Buy?", "content": "Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)has been a darling for tech and artificial intelligence (AI) investors over the past year, as it has continually hit new heights despite concerns about its soaring valuation. Lately, however, it has been falling sharply in value, along with the market as a whole. In just the past month, the stock fell more than 25% and it closed on Monday at a price of less than $84-- that's down 33% from its 52-week high of $125.41.Could this recent drop in value be your chance to buy into one of the hottestAI stockson the markets?Why Palantir may have a lot of room to growPalantir is a data analytics company that helps companies in their decision-making processes. Whether it's aiding governments in counterterrorism activities or giving commercial customers the best available information they need to make decisions, Palantir can stand to benefit from opportunities across many industries. The launch of its AI-powered platform has taken things to a whole new level, as is evident with the rapid acceleration of its growth rate in recent quarters.PLTR Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth)data byYChartsDuring the last three months of 2024, the company reported commercial revenue growth of 64% in the U.S., while U.S. government revenue increased by 45%. Palantir has been on a tear, and its impressive growth is a major reason the stock continues to be a hot buy. Even with the recent fall in value, shares of Palantir are up more than 255% over the past 12 months.Palantir's valuation remains the biggest obstacleWhile there's no denying Palantir has been a phenomenal, fast-growing business over the past few years, investors also can't deny that its valuation is incredibly high. Even with the recent drop in value, the stock is trading at close to a forward price-to-earnings ration of 160, based on analyst expectations.That is a massive premium investors are paying for the stock. And for that to be justifiable, you would need to believe that there is a tremendous amount of growth still on the horizon for the company. But even under those circumstances, you are effectively paying for a ton of future growth, and it could take years for Palantir's bottom line to catch up with where the stock is right now to make it look like a good investment.It leaves virtually nomargin of safetyfor the stock, which is why on any kind of bad news related to AI or even a hint that spending may not grow feverishly, the stock could be vulnerable to a significant correction. And that's why this can be a risky investment to hang on to, even despite the company's promising growth opportunities.Story ContinuesPalantir isn't worth its massive price tagThere are many high-powered AI stocks you can invest in, which trade at much more reasonable valuations than Palantir. Even AI chipmakerNvidiadoesn't look so egregiously overvalued -- it trades at just 26 times forward earnings.Palantir is doing well and there's plenty of growth potential for the business, but that doesn't mean investors should ignore its valuation. Buying the stock at a huge premium could result in limited returns, or worse -- significant losses, if reality doesn't line up with expectations. While Palantir's stock is certainly cheaper than it was a few weeks ago, it still could fall a whole lot further than where it is now. Investors will likely be better off pursuing growth stocks that are trading at much more reasonable valuations.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:TheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

{"article_id": "092500966", "title": "Why Palantir Could Be the First Victim of Trump's Trade War", "content": "Palantir(NASDAQ: PLTR)was one of the biggest winners of 2024 on the stock market, delivering a monster gain of 341%.Along the way, it reported accelerating revenue growth and improving operating margin in each quarter, and gained admission to theS&P 500.Thanks to its newartificial intelligence (AI)platform, the company has seen exceptional growth and profits. However, the stock market's winds suddenly seem to be shifting on Palantir.The stock continued to charge higher through the first seven weeks of the year, jumping 65% with the help of a strong fourth-quarter earnings report. But since then, the stock has nearly given up all of those gains, even as there's been little news. Instead, a combination of macro factors, including weakening consumer confidence, worries about federal government budget cuts, and the intensifying trade war all weighed on Palantir stock.It's becoming clear that Palantir has a lot to lose on an expanding trade war, and the stock is already looking like one of the first victims of Donald Trump's tariff plans. Keep reading to see why it could fall further from here.Image source: Getty Images.High-priced stocks tend to get hit the hardest in market correctionsTheNasdaq Compositehas entered a correction, defined as a decline of 10% or more from a recent high, reflecting shifting investor sentiment.Palantir was priced for perfection following its recent earnings report, and the macro environment suddenly looks far from perfect. Even after the recent pullback, Palantir trades at this writing at a sky-high price-to-sales ratio of 69, which is considerably more expensive than any other software stock of a similar market cap.To put that valuation in perspective, Palantir stock could fall by another 50%, and most investors would still consider it very expensive. If the stock market sell-off continues, Palantir is likely to experience outsize losses.The international business is already strugglingTrump's tariff threats ratcheted up geopolitical tensions and sparked some nationalistic fervor in parts of the world, including Canada and Europe. European defense stocks, for example, have soared, as it can no longer be assumed that the U.S. will protect Ukraine or the rest of Europe.That's likely to make it harder for Palantir to grow its business in Europe, a market in which it's already struggling and European governments and companies are more likely to turn to homegrown solutions.On the fourth-quarter earnings call, management noted that revenue grew just 4% in Europe in the fourth quarter, making up 13% of revenue. The company's challenges in Europe and other international markets are only likely to get harder in the current geopolitical environment.Story ContinuesFederal budget cuts are on the menuThe U.S. government made up more than 40% of Palantir's revenue last year, and it's also been a significant source of growth.The federal government is by far the company's most important customer, so budget cuts, imposed by the Department of Government Efficiency or the Trump administration's general push for slashing government costs, could be a problem for Palantir. The stock fell in February on reports that the Department of Defense planned to cut 8% from its budget in each of the next five years. The DoD is a major customer for Palantir.Maintaining its strong growth rate from U.S. government revenue is not going to be easy in the current environment, and any signs of cutbacks are going to pressure the stock.Palantir argued before that its software helps customers be more efficient, therefore saving money, but in the 2022 bear market, its revenue growth consistently decelerated. In uncertain economies, cautiousness around spending typically overpowers the cost-saving argument.Expensive products tend to be cyclicalSoftware companies target different customers at different price points. But expensive products tend to be highly cyclical, and Palantir's software is not cheap. Palantir finished 2024 with 711 customers and brought in $2.87 billion in revenue. That means the average Palantir customer spent $4 million on its products in 2024. Even for enterprise-level customers or the federal government, these aren't negligible costs, and they're likely to receive scrutiny if economic times get tough.Already, the threat of tariffs has forced a wide range of businesses to adopt a more cautious stance and weighed on consumer confidence. Spending on a software platform like Palantir might appear attractive in boom times to a lot of companies, but it's more likely to seem an unnecessary luxury when fears of a recession are already starting to drift through the market.Palantir is still high-riskIt might be tempting to view the recent sell-off as a buying opportunity, but Palantir could still fall a lot further from here if the macroeconomic outlook continues to deteriorate.The company established a strong competitive position in AI and with its deep data mining software platforms, but that's not enough to make the stock a winner at a time when it trades at a sky-high valuation, and macroeconomic uncertainty is sweeping the market right now.The expanding trade war and weakening consumer confidence don't mean the economy is headed for a recession, but if those risks increase, Palantir is likely to feel it more than the broad market. With uncertainty seemingly on the rise, the pullback in Palantir stock could be far from over.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:TheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

OpenAI and Musk have agreed to fast-track a trial over OpenAI\u2019s for-profit shift. Musk had previously bid to buy the AI startup, aiming to derail its journey of becoming one of the world\u2019s most important companies.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other top trending stocks now.The volatile tariff policies of the new US administration and a slowdown in AI-related enthusiasm took a toll on the market over the past few weeks. However, some analysts believe a rebound is due.Fundstrat\u2019s Tom Lee said in a latest program on CNBC that he believes the US stock market will begin to recover starting April 2. Here is how Lee explained the reasons behind his positive outlook:\u201cWhen markets fall this quickly from a 52-week high, just remember less than a month ago we were at all-time highs. That is a market pricing in a crisis. I\u2019d say almost 50% pricing in a recession, and we\u2019re assuming there\u2019s no Fed put now. The Fed is in a position to cut rates that really should mitigate the downside. I do think two other things that investors have to keep in mind, because many people just want to get out until April 2nd, is number one, I do think there\u2019s a very high probability that a tariff solution happens before the next three weeks happens. It\u2019s simple to see because China, Europe, Canada, Mexico since April 18th\u2014all of those countries have outperformed the US. I don\u2019t think that markets are that blind to say if Canada and Mexico are about to have a recession, they should outperform the US. The second thing people should keep in mind is that when you have a global crisis brewing\u2014and we highlighted like the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis\u2014that was a 12-day crisis, but the markets bottomed seven days into the crisis, five days before that crisis ended, the market had already recovered two-thirds of the losses.\u201dREAD ALSO:7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Termand8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest InFor this article, we picked 10 stocks notable Wall Street analysts were discussing recently.

(NASDAQ:PLTR)Number of Hedge Funds Investors: 41Michael Lee from Michael Lee Strategy said in a recent program on Schwab Network that he\u2019s bullish on Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) despite the stock\u2019s \u201castronomical\u201d multiple.Story Continues\u201cI\u2019m pretty close to fully invested. My all-time favorite stock that I\u2019ve ever seen, ever, is Palantir. The prospects for this company over the next three to five years are like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen. Morgan Stanley thinks AI software spend this year is roughly 60 billion, and that goes to 400 billion in 2028. Palantir\u2019s got a 7 to 9% market share of that. Now, if you extrapolate that out to 2028, that\u2019s a 20 to 30 billion revenue number, which is a 4 to 5x from where they\u2019re going to end up this year. And the way the operating leverage from their business works\u2014with the way they use their engineers and the fact that they\u2019ve been working on this technology for 20 years\u2014it\u2019s going to be a cash machine, a profit machine. As a SaaS company that\u2019s going to continue to grow at unimaginable rates, it\u2019s always going to have an astronomical multiple. I\u2019m going to be adding it there because I\u2019ve never seen a technology company ready to disrupt the world the way Palantir is.\u201dPalantir\u2019s valuation is concerning for many. Its revenue growth is expected to slow over the next two years, with estimates suggesting a 22% YoY growth rate, potentially bringing revenues to around $4 billion by fiscal 2026. If Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:PLTR) can improve margins by 100 basis points annually, it would be able to generate about $1.5 billion in adjusted operating income by FY26, with a present value of $1.3 billion when discounted at 8%. Applying an S&P 500-like growth multiple of 2.5 to 2.75 times earnings, Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:PLTR) would have a P/E of 46, translating to a price target of $27, significantly down from its current price.Baron Asset Fund stated the following regarding Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) in itsQ4 2024 investor letter:\u201cTwo software stocks that the Fund did not own,Palantir Technologies Inc.(NASDAQ:PLTR) and AppLovin Corporation, each gained more than 100% and accounted for 52% of the Benchmark\u2019s gain during the quarter. At year end 2024, Palantir was valued at approximately 200 times its expected 2024 earnings, while AppLovin was valued at 80 times. The market cap of each exceeded $100 billion, and the two stocks represented nearly 8% of the Index. Neither company met our criteria for investment. The total impact on relative performance from Palantir and AppLovin was about 7 times higher than we have seen historically for two securities that are unique to the Benchmark, showing just how unparalleled the event was and something that we believe is unlikely to be repeated.\u201dOverall, PLTRranks 9thon our list of top trending stocks now. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Notwithstanding the improvement, questions about the company's high value and dependence on government contractswhich can cause delays or budget restrictionsremain. Whether the long-term expansion possibilities of the stock justify its present price is still up for contention among analysts.With running margins estimated to be 45%, the corporation is forecast to increase sales by 31% in 2025. Reflecting great operational efficiency, Palantir's revenue climbed by 50% between 2022 and 2024 while its personnel only changed by 3%. Considered as a good sign of financial discipline is this capacity to scale income while maintaining minimum labor growth.Still a major component of Palantir's expansion plan are government contracts. Among the various fresh agreements the corporation is anticipated to land are a centralized payment monitoring system meant to increase cost control. Its position also helps to support the yearly audit of the Department of Defense, therefore increasing their link to government agencies.

Unfortunately for investors, both of these investment theses seem to be on their last legs.Let's dig deeper to see what that could mean for the company's shares in 2025 and beyond.A hype-driven rallySince its debut on theNasdaqthrough an initial public offering (IPO) in2020, Palantir has attracted a fair share of attention. The big-data analytics company has an exciting business model, offeringsoftware as a serviceto clients like the Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Defense.The company even helped the U.S. government track down Osama bin Laden, putting it at the forefront of military tech.When OpenAI introduced generative AI to the mainstream, management quickly pounced on the opportunity, synergizinglarge language models(LLMs) with its existing data analytics tools to make them more efficient and offer real-time insights in fast-paced scenarios such as battlefields.The stock price also may have benefited from the changing political climate, which culminated in Trump's election victory in 2024. Palantir's co-founder, Peter Thiel, donated to Trump's campaign and has a close relationship with Vice President JD Vance, who used to work for Thiel's global investment fund, Mithril Capital.But while these political relationships are interesting, it's hard to see how they will directly translate to sustainable shareholder value.The new administration might not benefit PalantirMany of the Trump administration's policies could put Palantir on the back foot. The best example might be the war in Ukraine, where the company helps the Ukrainian armed forces target Russian troops. The Trump administration has expressed a desire to end this war as soon as possible, which could reduce the market for Palantir's services.Palantir could also face further challenges in the United States, where it earns the lion's share of its revenue (around 67%). Under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon has pledged to cut 8% of its budget annually for the next five years (a reduction of $50 billion per year). And this could limit the company's ability to earn contracts.Image source: Getty Images.Operational results are lacklusterThe company's future business looks uncertain, but its current operations also leave much to be desired. Fourth-quarter revenue grew 36% year over year to $827.5 million, which is significantly lower than others in the AI industry likeNvidia, which grew sales 78% in its fiscal fourth quarter.Story ContinuesMany see Palantir as an AI company, but that narrative seems overblown. The company has incorporated generative AI tools into its software. However, operational performance is more in line with data analytics peers likeSnowflake, which grew 28% according to its most recent earnings report. Snowflake has also incorporated AI into its business, which means Palantir isn't the only game in town regarding this niche.The bottom line is where the alarm bells really start ringing. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization are $379.5 million, but this adds back a stunning $281.8 million instock-based compensation. Although stock-based compensation allows Palantir to save cash, this outflow looks excessive and could dilute investors' claims on future earnings.An out-of-touch valuationPalantir looks like just another data analytics company with no clear edge to justify its massive rally. Granted, its focus on military and government clients gives it some differentiation from the competition. But this might turn into a liability as the Trump administration pursues a policy of demilitarization and lower government spending.With a forwardprice-to-earnings(P/E) multiple of 156, Palantir's valuation doesn't account for its many challenges, and this leaves room for a substantial downside in 2025. Investors who want to bet on AI should look for more reasonably priced options.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

{"article_id": "200700304", "title": "Could Investing in Palantir Stock Make You a Millionaire?", "content": "Every so often, a stock captures the imagination of investors like few others can. The company's technology promises to be so innovative, so disruptive, that investors are willing to pay incredible multiples, believing that future returns justify massive current valuations.Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)is one such company. The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered juggernaut saw its stock price rise more than 1,200% in the last two years as it rode a wave of AI enthusiasm. Its ardent supporters believe that the company and its technology are leading a true paradigm shift. But is the hype justified?An open questionThere is a pressing question hanging over Wall Street: Can AI deliver enough value to justify the gargantuan sums of money tech firms are pouring into developing the technology?It's an expensive business, building and operating the data centers that enable modern AI applications like ChatGPT to run; this year, the big tech companies that do so are set to spend well over $300 billion on AI-powering infrastructure. The same companies spent $230 billion in 2024.Palantir is proving AI can deliver true valueIt's no surprise then that shareholders are eager to see a return on their investment -- one that is commiserate with the massive amount of spending. A tree that costs hundreds of billions of dollars had better bear some pretty expensive fruit.Palantir appears to be proving AI can deliver that kind of value -- or at least it's on a path to do so. In a market awash in smoke and mirrors, Palantir is expertly leveraging AI to enhance the operations of clients as diverse asFerrariand the U.S. Army. Its client growth has been explosive, reflecting the immense value and broad application of its technology. Its sales have followed suit.Take a look at the year-over-year growth over the last four quarters.Q1 2024Q2 2024Q3 2024Q4 2024Customer growth (YOY)42%41%39%43%Sales growth (YOY)21%27%30%36%Data source: Palantir Technologies.Palantir is also a very profitable company. Over the same period, the company nearly doubled its earnings per share (EPS) and raised its net margin from 36% to 39%.Valuation mattersIt is clear that Palantir is delivering substantial value, growing its business rapidly, and managing costs. I won't begin to deny that the company is executing at the top of its game. When all these are true, it's completely reasonable for investors to pay a premium for the stock.However, Palantir's current valuation, by almost any metric, is so extreme that investors have to proceed with caution. Palantir's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 446 is astronomical. Leading players in tech likeAlphabetandMicrosoftcarry P/Es of roughly 30. No, this isn't apples to apples, as the latter two are mature companies, but it's still useful to keep the numbers in perspective.Story ContinuesLook at it this way: If Palantir maintains a growth rate of 30% for the next 10 years -- a highly unlikely feat -- its stock wouldn't even keep pace with the market if it holds a still-expensive P/E of 60 by 2035. In other words, even if the company performs beyond any reasonable expectations, its stock is likely to underperform what you would expect from a broad-market index fund.So, to the question at hand: Can investing in Palantir make you a millionaire? For most investors, not unless the stock sees a massive decline; it is just too highly valued at the moment. Forexceptionally risk-tolerant investors, Palantir may be an interesting addition to a well-diversified portfolio, but if I were you, I would still wait for the stock to come back to earth.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

{"article_id": "090600943", "title": "Palantir Technologies Is 30% Below Its All-Time High: Here's How Far It Can Fall", "content": "For much of the last two-and-a-half years, the bulls have been in firm control on Wall Street. Since the 2022 bear market bottomed out, we've witnessed theDow Jones Industrial Average,S&P 500, andNasdaq Compositeall gallop to numerous record-closing highs.While a confluence of factors is responsible for lifting the broader market, such as a resilient U.S. economy, a tapering inflation rate, andDonald Trump's return to the White House, nothing has played a bigger role in sending stocks higher than the evolution ofartificial intelligence (AI).Software and systems that are empowered with AI have the capacity to reason and act on their own, and can potentially evolve to learn new tasks, all without the aid of human intervention. It's a technology the analysts at PwC believe can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade.Most investors rightly pegNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)as the face of the AI revolution. After all, Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the mainstay hardware powering AI-accelerated data centers. Generative AI solutions and the training of large language models likely doesn't happen at scale without Nvidia's GPUs.Image source: Getty Images.However, Nvidia has taken a back seat, in terms of parabolic stock gains, to AI-driven data-mining specialistPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR). At one point earlier this year, shares of Palantir had climbed by close to 2,000% since the start of 2023.Yet over the last four weeks (as of March 17), this AI darling has lost 30% of its value following its all-time closing high of $124.62 per share. It begs the question: How far can the hottest AI stock fall?Investors have rallied around Palantir's irreplaceability, profits, and future growth prospectsBefore looking to the future, it's important to understand the dynamics of how we go to a point where Palantir is suddenly one of Wall Street's most-influential and widely owned tech stocks.What's made Palantir such an AI darling is the irreplaceability of its two platforms: Gotham and Foundry. The former is powered by AI and responsible for helping federal governments collect and analyze copious amounts of data. Gotham also assists the U.S. and its immediate allies with military mission planning and execution.Meanwhile, Foundry is an AI and machine learning-propelled platform that helps businesses make sense of their data in order to streamline their operations and improve their margins. It can assist with everything from supply chain management to automated, data-driven decision making that frees up human personnel for other tasks.Story ContinuesWhile some businesses may offer bits and pieces of what Palantir's cloud-based software-as-a-service model brings to the table, no other business comes close to matching Palantir's products and services at scale. Generally, investors will pay a premium for businesses that have a sustained moat.Palantir is also benefiting from its push to recurring generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profits well ahead of Wall Street's consensus forecast. Recurring profits from Gotham is a crystal-clear sign that its operating model works and is sustainable. Additionally, it doesn't hurt that the contracts Palantir is landing with the U.S. government often span four or five years, which leads to highly predictable operating cash flow.Further, Palantir's push to new highs in February may have to do with President Trump's return to the White House and Republicans controlling both houses of Congress. Historically, the GOP has favored aggressive defense spending, and Palantir's Gotham platform is viewed as a key puzzle piece to protecting America's interests -- including its AI innovation.On paper, Palantir would appear to be ideally positioned to win government contract under the Trump administration.Image source: Getty Images.History weighs in -- how far could Palantir stock plunge?With a clearer understanding of how Palantir peaked at a market cap of more than $266 billion on Feb. 18, let's allow history to weigh in to make an educated guess of how far its stock could fall.One of the more prevailing concerns for current and prospective Palantir shareholders is the checkered past of next-big-thing innovations, of which artificial intelligence certainly qualifies. Since (and including) the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, every next-big-thing technology/innovation has endured a bubble-bursting event.The consistent problem for investors is their eyes grow bigger than the early stage adoption and utility of game-changing technologies. Each and every one of these technologies/innovations has needed ample time to mature, including the internet, 3D printing, blockchain technology, and so on. With most businesses still lacking concrete game plans to monetize their AI investments and/or optimize their AI solutions, it looks to be only a matter of time before the AI bubble bursts.If there's a silver lining for Palantir Technologies, it's that its revenue is based on lengthy contracts and subscriptions. Even if the AI bubble were to burst, as history suggests it will, Palantir's operating cash flow wouldn't feel any immediate pain.The other historic concern for Palantir has to do with its valuation.As noted earlier, businesses that are viewed as irreplaceable tend to be given a premium valuation on Wall Street. Palantir absolutely fits this definition. The question is: How much of a premium is too much?PLTR PS Ratiodata byYCharts. PS Ratio = price-to-sales ratio.Prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble in March 2000, internet leaders likeCisco Systems,Microsoft, andAmazonall peaked at respective price-to-sales (P/S) ratios ranging from 31 to 43. Interestingly enough, this is also the range AI behemoth Nvidia peaked at last summer, with a P/S ratio of 42 and change. For market-leading companies of next-big-thing trends, this range has served as a fairly constant upper bound.When the closing bell tolled on Feb. 18 for Palantir, its P/S ratio hovered around 100! This is a virtually unheard-of figure for any company on the leading edge of a next-big-thing trend -- and it's certainly not a valuation that appears sustainable in any way.Following Palantir's 30% pullback, its P/S ratio has dipped into the mid-70s. Unfortunately, this is still double the range where market leaders have peaked prior to a next-big-thing bubble bursting.Based solely on history and how other market leaders have traded following their P/S ratio peaks, I'd expect Palantir to eventually work its way to a P/S ratio of closer to 20. Although steady annual revenue growth of around 25% will help lift the floor for Palantir stock, its premium valuation and the growing likelihood of an AI bubble will act as concrete weights around its proverbial ankles. This would take Palantir stock down to a range of the high-$30s to low-$40s, relative to a closing price of $87.35 on March 17, and its all-time closing high of $124.62.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:TheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.In his recent appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on President Trump\u2019s tariffs against Mexico and Canada and his proposal of tax cuts. Cramer made the comments before the President announced that he could walk back the tariffs. Cramer noted Trump\u2019s hard-hitting approach during his State of the Union address to Congress. He remarked:\u201cWell look the President did say listen the tax cuts are coming and don\u2019t worry about it. I don\u2019t think this is permanent. Look when I hear the bullishness, I just say those people went to bed early and I appreciate that. They may have to get an early start to the day. But the President that I heard last night is, that is Sherman\u2019s march to the sea this guy. I mean he is just gonna get it done. And anyone in his way is going to lose. And right now it\u2019s about bringing jobs back and the pain that GM and Ford are gonna suffer.\u201dWhen his co-host David Faber pointed out that the President aimed to reduce fentanyl shipments from the two countries through his tariffs, Cramer responded:\u201cI don\u2019t trade fentanyl, I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s trading. Maybe it\u2019s trading over in Germany, I don\u2019t know. I trade [US automotive stocks]. And what I\u2019m telling you right now is that these stocks are even down here dangerous if you believe what the President said. Dangerous.\u201dThe CNBC TV show host added that the pain is a necessary part of Trump\u2019s actions. \u201cTrue, but I mean that\u2019s, we have to go through this gauntlet. And then that\u2019s on the other side,\u201d he commented. I think the President\u2019s been very clear. About the order of things,\u201d Cramer added. He shared that investors were hoping that the President would first introduce the tax cuts and then the tariffs would follow through. As a result, Cramer concluded:\u201cOnce this is through, we\u2019ll have a good reason to buy stocks. You have to anticipate it. The President doesn\u2019t want to wreck the stock market. That is simplistic. The President wants to get this done. And once he gets it done. Then we\u2019ll be fine. You have to stay the course. David, there isn\u2019t anything he\u2019s saying that he didn\u2019t tell you he\u2019s gonna do.\u201dHe also believes that it will be a while before Trump\u2019s tariffs are over. According to Cramer: \u201c[I]t just seems like the approach that the President is doing is so rapid. . . .I do think that it\u2019s gonna be done this year. We\u2019re seeing so many companies, every company that you mentioned that we\u2019re gonna talk about . . anything in the mall, we\u2019re seeing a lot of negatives. But that\u2019s not gonna last if the President finishes. . .\u201dStory ContinuesCramer also believes \u201cthe President is in a hurry because he wants to give us something good this year.\u201dOur MethodologyTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on March 5th.For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:PLTR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 64Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) is one of Jim Cramer\u2019s most frequently discussed stocks. Over the course of the year, the TV show host has praised the firm\u2019s CEO Alex Karp, wondered whether it\u2019d be better to rename the ticker to KARP, and cited Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR)\u2019s potential to benefit from Elon Musk\u2019s push to reduce spending at the Pentagon. He has also been a long-time supporter of the stock and had predicted the shares would touch $100 before they did. Here are his latest comments about Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR):\u201c[On William Blair\u2019s recent note] Again, what\u2019s happened, there were three really big sell, uh, I\u2019d say horrendous antipathy by three analysts. And two folded and now the third folds. And now Alex Karp is able to sell more than two billion dollars worth of stock. That\u2019s, you know he\u2019s got a lot of stock. Uh, but I do think that this is once again people saying wait a second they weren\u2019t hurt by government cutbacks. They could be enhanced. My belief has always been that when they get to the Defense Department, Musk will say to Alex Karp. Fix it. Make it more effective. Make it more lethal. And that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen.\u201dOverall, PLTRranks 8thon our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.

Losses spread across the sector. For instance,NVIDIANVDA has gained 13%,International Business MachinesIBM has climbed 6%, andOracleORCL has gained 17% in a month.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBeing a volatile stock, this level of pullback is not entirely surprising. However, with PLTR\u2019s strong fundamentals and robust growth prospects, it\u2019s worth examining whether this dip presents a buying opportunity.Palantir's Role in the Evolving AI EconomyWe are in the midst of an AI boom characterized by rapid advancements and a proliferation of AI models. By 2026, the oversaturation of AI solutions is expected to become even more evident. Palantir has recognized this shift and strategically positioned itself to capitalize on the changing dynamics of the AI economy.While many companies are engaged in an arms race to develop slightly improved AI models, Palantir differentiates itself by focusing on seamless AI integration into enterprise operations. The company refers to this approach as quantified exceptionalism, delivering transformative, measurable outcomes such as time savings, cost reductions and productivity enhancements.At the core of Palantir\u2019s strategy is its Artificial Intelligence Platform, which enables businesses to structure and organize their data \u2014 whether financial, supply chain, operational, or HR-related \u2014 so that AI can process and execute tasks more effectively. By leveraging an ontology-driven approach, Palantir creates digital representations of entire enterprises, allowing AI to interact seamlessly with business operations. Unlike companies that contribute to the oversupply of AI models, Palantir is actively shaping the demand side of the AI economy, positioning itself as a key player in enterprise AI adoption.PLTR's Strong Financial Position and Growth TrajectoryPalantir\u2019s financial health further reinforces its investment appeal. As of Dec. 31, 2024, the company held $5.2 billion in cash and equivalents, with zero debt, providing ample liquidity to invest in growth initiatives.Moreover, Palantir\u2019s recent financial performance underscores its strength. In 2024, revenues surged 29% year over year, with its U.S. commercial business experiencing 54% growth. The company has also secured several high-profile customer deals, including partnerships with Walgreens and Heineken, which have driven a bullish sentiment in the stock market. Additionally, Palantir has formed strategic alliances with TWG Global, EYSA, Voyager and Databricks, further solidifying its market position.Story ContinuesUpbeat Earnings Projections and Analyst ConfidenceThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Palantir\u2019s first-quarter 2025 earnings stands at 13 cents per share, reflecting 62.5% year-over-year growth. For 2025 and 2026, earnings are projected to rise 37% and 26%, respectively, compared to prior-year figures. Sales are also expected to see robust growth, increasing 36.3% in the first quarter of 2025, with full-year sales projected to rise 32.2% in 2024 and 27.9% in 2025.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnalyst sentiment further reinforces this positive outlook. Over the past 60 days, six upward earnings estimate revisions have been recorded for the first quarter of 2025, with no downward adjustments. Similarly, nine upward revisions for 2025 and five for 2026 highlight growing confidence in Palantir\u2019s trajectory. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 earnings has increased by 16.7%, while the 2026 estimate has risen by 20.7%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchYes! A Buy-the-Dip OpportunityPalantir\u2019s significant stock decline may appear concerning, but its strong financials, impressive growth trajectory, and strategic positioning in the AI economy suggest a compelling investment case. The company is capitalizing on the evolving AI landscape, focusing on enterprise integration rather than just AI model development. With a debt-free balance sheet, expanding customer base, and analyst optimism, PLTR appears well-positioned for long-term growth.Given these factors, investors may view this pullback as a buy-the-dip opportunity, especially as Palantir continues to execute its strategy and generate real, quantifiable value for its clients and shareholders.PLTR currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

After getting hammered by a 30% selloff, one of its most vocal skeptics, William Blair's Louie DiPalma, is changing his tuneupgrading the stock from Underperform to Market Perform. While he still sees downside risks, particularly from potential government contract delays, he's acknowledging the undeniable AI hype keeping Palantir afloat. The stock's valuation remains steep, trading at nearly 100 times next year's free cash flow estimates, but investors continue to give AI plays a premium. If the market shifts back to risk-on mode, Palantir could reclaim its previous highs.That said, this ride is far from smooth. Palantir's heavy reliance on government contracts means that looming budget cutsor worse, a government shutdown on March 15could slam the stock even further. But here's the kicker: its software isn't just another expense, it's a tool that can help optimize spending. On top of that, Palantir is still in the mix for major military contracts, which could provide a much-needed boost. While volatility is expected to stick around, DiPalma sees the stock trading in a range rather than outright collapsing, signaling a shift in sentiment.The real question now is whether Palantir can justify its premium valuation in a shifting market. AI euphoriafueled by OpenAI's recent $300 billion-plus valuationmight keep investors engaged, but if revenue growth slows, that sky-high multiple could come crashing down. A valuation reset to 40 times free cash flow isn't off the table if the fundamentals don't hold up. For now, Palantir is caught between AI-fueled optimism and the uncertainty of government spending, making it one of the most debated stocks on Wall Street.This article first appeared onGuruFocus.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/palantirs-wild-comeback-why-notorious-172006303.html", "published_date": "2025-03-05T17:20:06.000Z"}
{"article_id": "130011922", "title": "Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know", "content": "Palantir Technologies Inc.(PLTR) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this company have returned -32.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -9.6% change. The Zacks Technology Services industry, to which Palantir Technologies belongs, has lost 25.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Palantir Technologies is expected to post earnings of $0.13 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +62.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $0.56 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +36.6%. This estimate has changed +2.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.70 indicates a change of +25.7% from what Palantir Technologies is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Palantir Technologies is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Story ContinuesThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Palantir Technologies, the consensus sales estimate of $864.52 million for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +36.3%. The $3.79 billion and $4.84 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +32.2% and +27.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPalantir Technologies reported revenues of $827.52 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +36%. EPS of $0.14 for the same period compares with $0.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $777.49 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.44%. The EPS surprise was +27.27%.Over the last four quarters, Palantir Technologies surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Palantir Technologies is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Palantir Technologies.

{"article_id": "093500670", "title": "Should You Forget Palantir and Buy These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead?", "content": "While it's well off its recent highs,Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)was one of the best-performing stocks in 2024 and early 2025. However, those gains have led to an extreme valuation, with the stock trading at a forwardprice-to-sales (P/S)multiple of 52 times 2025 analyst revenue estimates.The company has been seeing accelerating revenue growth, with revenue climbing 36% last quarter, led by a 64% jump in U.S. commercial revenue. The company's success stems from its focus on the application and workflow layers ofartificial intelligence (AI). Palantir aims to become an AI operating system for its users, creating a platform that can help organizations run AI applications in a real-world environment. It has been highly successful in bringing in new commercial customers through its use of AI boot camps to train and onboard customers, and now it has a big opportunity as it moves these customers from proof-of-concept work into production.However, the company is very closely tied to the U.S. government, its largest customer which accounted for more than 40% of its revenue in the fourth quarter, and the government is currently undergoing massive cost-saving measures and slashing budgets. This includes the White House telling the Department of Defense to reduce its budget by 8% a year over the next five years. It's unknown whether Palantir will be helped or hurt by these DOD budget cuts, but it's a big risk.Given its very high valuation and the risks associated with its largest customer, let's look at two alternative cheaper software AI names to consider.SalesforceSalesforce(NYSE: CRM)is known as the leader in customer relationship management (CRM) software. Through the acquisitions of Mulesoft, Tableau, and Slack in recent years it has also gotten into the areas of automation, analytics, and employee communication. The company has always been at the forefront of innovation, being one of the first companies to adopt the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, which revolutionized the entire software industry.Salesforce hopes to be a leader in the next evolution of AI, called agentic AI. Much of the early focus on AI has been on what is known as generative AI, where AI will create content, whether it be text, images, or video, based on user prompts. An example of this is using ChatGPT to help plan a wedding. ChatGPT can create a plan, including a task list, based on user inputs. Agentic AI goes beyond generative AI by going out and autonomously completing tasks with little human intervention. So in the case of planning a wedding, it could also rent the venue, hire the caterer and other vendors, and execute other necessary tasks.Story ContinuesSalesforce is looking to be the leader in agentic AI with its Agentforce solution. The agentic AI platform offers a number of out-of-the-box AI agents and allows customers to build and customize their own AI agents using its no-code and low-code tools. The company says the AI agents can be equipped with any business knowledge in order to fill their role and complete necessary tasks while having guardrails of what the agents can and cannot do.Thus far, Agentforce has drawn a lot of interest from customers, with Salesforce saying it has 5,000 Agentforce deals (including 3,000 paying deals) since it was launched in October. Agentforce is a consumption product that costs $2 per conversation, so the upside for Salesforce is absolutely huge if it can prove its solution saves its customers money. It has also recently introduced AgentExchange, which includes 200 initial partners, including companies likeAlphabetandWorkday, and hundreds of ready-made app actions, integrations, and templates. This should help expand use cases and foster adoption.Meanwhile, the stock is reasonably priced, trading at a forward price-to-sales (P/S) multiple under 7 and a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.Image source: Getty Images.SentinelOneSentinelOne(NYSE: S)is a fast-growing AI-powered cybersecurity company that has a nice catalyst ahead of it later this year. The company is focused on endpoint security, which is the protection of a network and its endpoints, such as smartphones and computers. Its main offering is its Singularity Platform, which uses AI to predict, monitor, and eliminate threats.The company competes withCrowdStrike(NASDAQ: CRWD)and has been looking to take advantage of its larger competitor's earlier outage that caused a lot of disruption. Its platform ranks highly in theGartnerMagic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms but trails CrowdStrike. However, one of its big selling points is that SentinelOne can automatically roll back any changes to return a client's system to where it was before an attack occurred, eliminating the time-consuming, manual fix that some CrowdStrike customers dealt with after its outage. Last quarter, the company said it saw a record number of competitive wins versus CrowdStrike, and a Fortune 50 company switched to its platform.Meanwhile, SentinelOne is seeing huge success upselling its Purple AI solution, which helps analysts hunt complex security threats through the use of natural language prompts. It said it is the fastest-growing platform in its history.Importantly, though, the company has a big catalyst later this year when enterprise PC vendorLenovowill begin shipping all its PCs with SentinelOne's Singularity Platform on them. The two companies are also developing a new managed detection and response (MDR) service using AI and endpoint detection and response (EDR) capabilities based on the Singularity Platform.

{"article_id": "120000417", "title": "Palantir Stock Sell-Off: Is Now the Time to Buy the Dip?", "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks haven't fared well over the past few weeks. Many of the most prominent AI stocks\u00a0 tumbled, which may lead many investors to wonder if now is a great time to scoop up some of these dominant companies.Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)hasn't escaped this rout, and its stock has fallen over 35% from its all-time high. That's a significant drop, but is the dip worth buying?Palantir's software has seen its growth spike in recent quartersPalantir has become one of the most popular AI stock picks due to its top-notch data analytics software. Originally, its software was intended for government use. It took several data inputs, processed them, and then gave those with decision-making authority the best real-time information possible. This use case eventually expanded to the commercial side, although government revenue still makes up the majority of Palantir's total revenue.One of the biggest innovations that Palantir has launched over the past few years is its AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform). AIP allows clients to integrate AI throughout the inner workings of a business, rather than have it be used on the side.This is critical for multiple reasons. First, it allows management to control what information is fed into an AI model. This prevents information leaks, as sensitive information (be it classified government intel or trade secrets) could be uploaded into a third-party AI model, where the company has no control over what's done with the data. It's also useful because it forces employees to use AI models, which could be better decision-makers than humans.Those are just a few benefits of AIP, although the list could go on.All this adds up to the hype behind Palantir's stock, as it has brought strong growth for the company. In Q4, Palantir's revenue rose 36% year over year to $828 million. That strength is expected to continue throughout 2025, with Q1 revenue expected to be $860 million (36% growth) and 2025 revenue to be $3.75 billion (31% growth) at the midpoint.Furthermore, unlike many of its software peers, Palantir is also profitable. While profit margins took a dip in the fourth quarter, it was due to a huge spike in stock-based compensation, as management rewarded its employees for the strong year by pulling forward the vesting date of their stock options.While this may bother Wall Street, it's an admirable move and something that investors should likely ignore, as Palantir'soperating marginis still trending in the right direction if this one-time expense is ignored.Story ContinuesPLTR Operating Margin (Quarterly)data byYChartsIf you exclude the effect of the one-time stock-based compensation bill, Palantir's Q4 operating margin would have been 17% -- a record high. In Q1, Palantir's strong operating margin should return, but it's something that investors should keep an eye on.Palantir is a strong business overall, with rapid growth and strong financials. However, its stock was rather pricey before the sell-off. Has any of that changed?The growth priced into Palantir's stock is unbelievableValuing Palantir's stock is tricky. Using the traditional trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio doesn't work because the company hasn't posted a full year of sustained earnings. The forward P/E could be used, but at 150 times forward earnings, the stock is almost too pricey to comprehend.I think the best way to value Palantir's stock is to test what assumptions are baked into the stock price, and then check to see if there's any room for investors to make profits. Let's make these assumptions:Palantir's revenue growth will remain at 30% over the next five years.Palantir's profit margin rises to 30%, ranking it among the best software companies.The effects of stock-based compensation are ignored.If Palantir does all three of those things over the next five years, it will produce revenue of $10.6 billion and profits of $3.19 billion. That's substantial growth from its current $2.87 billion in revenue and $462 million in profits, but it would still yield an expensive price.At that level, Palantir would be valued at 61.3 times earnings. But here's the kicker: Palantir would only achieve that valuation (which is still rather expensive) if its stock price didn't budge from today's levels over the next five years.This tells me there's no margin of safety in the stock price, and that the stock is highly overvalued. But this doesn't mean that the stock price can't continue rising, as hype can drive a stock a long way. However, financial results matter over the long term, and Palantir doesn't have the growth to justify its current price tag.As a result, I think investors should stay away from the stock, as it has a way to fallbefore it's even close to considering buying again.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

This suite of developments may have played a role in driving a 16% increase in the company's quarter-on-quarter share price. Additionally, the company's completion of a share buyback program, finalized on February 18, might have bolstered investor confidence. Meanwhile, the broader market context saw mixed performance, with the Nasdaq Composite experiencing declines amid tech sector fluctuations and broader economic uncertainties. Despite these market headwinds, Palantir's growth in strategic initiatives appeared to resonate positively with investors, contrasting with the general downturn in tech stocks, as illustrated by declines in other major tech companies like Tesla and Nvidia.Our comprehensive valuation report raises the possibility that Palantir Technologies is priced higher than what may be justified by its financials.NasdaqGS:PLTR Earnings Per Share Growth as at Mar 2025The best AI stocks today may lie beyond giants like Nvidia and Microsoft. Find the next big opportunity with these 23 smaller AI-focused companies with strong growth potential through early-stage innovation in machine learning, automation, and data intelligence that could fund your retirement.Palantir Technologies has experienced a very large total shareholder return of 584.99% over the past three years. This performance contrasts with broader tech market challenges. Several key developments have contributed to this growth. The company's inclusion in the NASDAQ-100 in January 2025 enhanced its visibility and credibility in the market. In December 2024, Palantir expanded its partnership with the U.S. Army for a strategic project valued at US$400 million, signaling strong government trust and long-term collaboration potential.Additionally, consistent revenue growth strengthened Palantir's market position. For instance, 2024 full-year sales rose to US$2.87 billion, up from US$2.23 billion, supported by robust client engagements like those with Voyager Technologies on AI solutions. Palantir's earnings growth of 120.3% also outpaced the software industry average. These factors, combined with strategic collaborations, have been pivotal in shaping the company's impressive performance against market headwinds.Hold shares in Palantir Technologies?

{"article_id": "110000328", "title": "AI Stock Sell-Off: Should You Buy Palantir or Nvidia Stock on the Dip?", "content": "Two of the market's most popular artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been heavily sold off over the past few weeks. At the time of this writing,Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)andPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)were down 25% and 32%, respectively, from their all-time highs.This begs the question: Are either of these two worth buying on the dip? Let's take a look -- the answer may surprise you as to which is the superior stock to buy right now.Both companies have strong positions in the AI raceFirst, let's talk about what each company does.Nvidia makesgraphics processing units (GPUs)and the infrastructure to support their use. GPUs are the computing muscle behind AI, and Nvidia has a dominant market share in this sector.Most of the AI revolution has been powered by Nvidia's Hopper architecture (like its H100 or H200 GPUs), but the company is still ramping up production of its latest architecture, Blackwell. These GPUs are far more powerful than their predecessors and will be a massive growth driver for years to come.Palantir makes AI-powered data analysis software. The easiest way to describe how its software works is: data in, insights out, with AI working hard in the middle.This simple concept has grown into a massive business for Palantir, with customers worldwide in both the government and commercial sectors. One product that's driving a ton of growth right now is its AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform). It allows users to interweave AI throughout a business' inner workings, allowing them to automate processes with AI agents and have AI models built into tasks that employees do every day.Both companies have a strong investment thesis, but that does nothing for determining which is the better buy right now. To determine that, let's look at their financials and valuations.Palantir's valuation is far higher than Nvidia'sIn terms of scale, Nvidia and Palantir don't compare well. Over the past 12 months, Nvidia has generated revenue of $130 billion versus Palantir's $2.87 billion.NVDA Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.Just because Nvidia makes a boatload more money than Palantir doesn't necessarily make it a better stock, but it does give investors a clue as to the size comparison between these two.Despite Nvidia's size, it's also projected to grow a lot faster this year. For its 2026 fiscal year (ending January 2026), Wall Street analysts expect revenue of $204 billion, indicating 56% growth. For 2025, Wall Street analysts expect Palantir to grow its revenue by 32% to $3.79 billion. Clearly, Nvidia has a growth advantage over Palantir, so this is one victory for Nvidia.Story ContinuesMoving to valuation, it's another blowout win for Nvidia.NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts.Nvidia trades for a dirt cheap 25 times forward earnings, especially considering the massive market opportunity of AI hardware. Palantir is far more expensive at 144 times forward earnings. However, some Palantir bulls may reply that this is because Nvidia is far more mature, and Palantir's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)\u00a0isn't the best measure.I'll entertain that argument, so let's project growth Palantir has baked into its stock price. Let's assume these three things:Palantir's revenue growth accelerates to 35% and stays there for seven years.The company's profit margin rises to 30%, a top-tier software company margin.The effects of its rising share count are ignored.If those three things come true over the next seven years, the company will produce revenue of $23.4 billion and profits of $7 billion. That's a huge increase over today's figures, but it would still value its stock at 27 times seven-year forward earnings.This means that even if Palantir exceeds growth expectations and holds them steady for seven years, and its stock price stays absolutely flat, it will still be more expensive than Nvidia is right now.That makes this analysis very easy for me: Buy Nvidia.There's no reason to hold Palantirwith the absurd assumptions baked into the stock price, and that money would be better invested in a solid growth company like Nvidia.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:TheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

{"article_id": "135800866", "title": "This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Has Surged 1,000% Over the Past 2 Years. Is a Split on the Horizon?", "content": "Memories can become short when markets get turbulent.Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)was at an all-time high less than a month ago, but has quickly tumbled approximately 30% since its peak as the broaderNasdaq Compositehas entered a correction. But if you zoom out, the stock is up about 1,000% over the past two years, even with the recent decline.That's seriously impressive. TheS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)historically returns an average ofroughly 10% annually-- some years much more; some years much less, even a loss. Wall Street's excitement for artificial intelligence (AI) and Palantir'saccelerating growth, emerging leadership in AI software, and long-term potentialhave fueled the stock's ascension.When stock prices rocket higher like this, you sometimes get stock splits, which increase the number of shares while decreasing the price proportionally. Individual investors generally love stock splits because they lower the share price, making it easier to buy shares for those without access to fractional shares. Remember, stock splits do this by increasing the share count, so the stock isn't fundamentally cheaper. The share price is lower because each share represents less equity in the company.So, should investors expect Palantir to split its stock anytime soon? Here are two key things to consider.1. Palantir's stock price isn't exorbitantly highArguably, the primary benefit of stock splits is that they make stocks easier to buy or sell and remove an emotional barrier for folks looking only at sharepricerather thanvalue. For individual investors, it can be easier to accumulate shares when you can buy them at lower prices. (Don't forget some brokerages offer fractional shares for those who don't have enough investing cash for a full share.) For company employees sitting on stock-based compensation, having more shares at a lower price makes it easier to control how much they cash out at any given time.While Palantir stock has done tremendously well over the past couple of years, it closed Tuesday at $78, so there's no real sticker shock there.2. Share price momentum has turned lowerThere's an additional argument that Palantir's recent price momentum is working against a split happening. Long-term investors shouldn't put too much emphasis on near-term share prices, but price momentum does impact sentiment toward a company.\u00a0 A stock split sends a message to investors.It might be seen as a positive when a company's stock is red hot. It says: Hey, things are going great, and we want to make shares more affordable, so more investors can participate in our success. On the other hand, a split while the stock is struggling could send a negative message. People don't like seeing low share prices, so splitting when the stock is dropping isn't as likely.Story ContinuesPalantir is currently on a slide; shares have fallen over 30% over the past several weeks, so I think that argues against an impending stock split.Nobody can predict short-term share prices, so Palantir's slide could end soon, but it could also continue, especially if investors balk more at its high valuation.Check out its price-to-sales ratio in the chart below.PLTR PS Ratiodata byYChartsEven the greatNvidia, arguably the most successful AI stock over these past two years, peaked at a price-to-sales ratio of 45, and that makes Palantir look even more expensive. Palantir's share price could drop 50% if its valuation reverts closer to other AI stocks.Should investors expect a stock split?Remember, stock splits don't fundamentally change anything about a stock other than its share price, so investors should never buy or sell a stock based on the prospects of a stock split.That said, stock splits are most likely when a stock has momentum, growth expectations, and a share price that has become seemingly burdensome to investors. Palantir doesn't check all those boxes today.The stock has been a huge winner, and Palantir's business is poised to grow for the foreseeable future.\u00a0Yet the stock's aggressive valuation already reflected much of that. Now that it's begun unwinding, it's hard to see management deciding to split the stock.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(PLTR) Can Help The Pentagon Reduce Costs", "content": "We recently published an article titledJim Cramer Discusses These 11 Stocks & Says Trump's In \"Accelerated Computing\" Tariff Mode.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.In his recent appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented on the devastation from the California wildfires and its impact on the services business. Cramer wondered \"whether we're supposed to be thinking about how much business was really, service business was hurt because of California.\" He also contemplated whether wealthy people who were invested in the \"service part of the economy\" seemed to be \"just, not spending, because they don't know what their situation is.\"One of Cramer's favorite barometers of the stock market performance is his bear-bull indicator. The show marked a rare occasion this year when the CNBC TV show host mentioned this indicator. Cramer shared that \"The bull indicator is the lowest since June 2022, and bear's the highest since September 2022. So you got, it's reflected everywhere. The level of confusion that's turning into negativity.\"One sector that came to his attention during the show was the alcoholic beverages industry. According to Cramer, \"The stoners aren't making money. Beer's not making any money. Hard liquor's not,\u00a0 oh my god the browns, people talk about the browns. They're down so much.\"He shared some of the reasons behind why alcohol stocks might be suffering. Cramer outlined:\"The numbers are just incredible. People just have shifted to food. What it really is this they want one beer instead of two. They want, instead of having two margis they'll have one margi. And that's the big change. It's moderation. And that is amazing because we've never seen moderation. We've seen people just drink more and more and more. And then the price went up very big. None of these liquor companies are willing to cut prices. I don't know why they're not. They'll all break one day. They're just going to break. They'll break.\"As markets opened during his show, Cramer commented that they were struggling after President Trump's latest tariff announcements. \"It's a fraught moment,\" he outlined and added, \"I don't want anyone to think that we're minimizing it. It's a very fraught moment. Because the President is in accelerated computing mode on tariffs.\"Story ContinuesContinuing with the analogy of the AI GPUs, Cramer shared:\"Between, yes, pre-train and post-train, I don't know. I mean look I try to be constructive about this stuff. Last night I couldn't be, because I said look, these are great American companies and they have no idea . . . they don't know what to do.

(PLTR) the High Growth Cybersecurity Stock To Buy?A software engineer intently typing code into a laptop with multiple screens in an office.Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q4 2024: 64Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) is one of Cramer's most commonly discussed stocks. The firm provides data analytics products and services. Over the past twelve months, it has garnered attention due to its ability to help businesses transform via AI and through its role as a defense contractor. Cramer believes that Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) can help the Pentagon reduce costs. The firm's shares slipped by 32% in late February as investors wondered whether it might end up being a target of cost-cutting instead. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR)'s recent share price performance left Cramer flummoxed as he commented on the firm in the broader context of other stocks and wondered what was driving the shares:\"Yeah, all [PLTR, other stocks] back.

{"article_id": "081000827", "title": "My Top 5 Bargain AI Stocks to Buy in the Nasdaq Correction", "content": "TheNasdaq, an index that led overall stock market gains over the past two years, has done just the opposite over the past few weeks. The tech-heavy benchmark fell into correction territory, dropping more than 10% from its most recent peak on Dec. 16. The reason for this major turnaround? With concern mounting about the impact ofPresident Trump's tariffson the economy and corporate earnings, some investors have shifted out of growth stocks -- including artificial intelligence (AI) players. Growth companies generally are most sensitive to the economic backdrop, making them the first to suffer when uncertainty is high.But even though it might feel intimidating to invest in growth companies during tough or uncertain times, it actually has proven to be a fantastic strategy for long term investors. That's because, over time, the Nasdaq always has gone on to recover and grow -- aftereverydownturn or crash. So if you buy a fund that tracks the index or a handful of quality stocks now, you may set yourself up for a significant win over the long haul.The reason to buy at this point is, following recent declines, many AI stocks are trading for bargain prices -- and the AI growth story is far from over. Let's check out my top five to buy in the Nasdaq correction.Image source: Getty Images.1. NvidiaNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)isthe stockto buy to gain exposure to AI, a market expected to surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade. The company is the leader in the AI chip market and has built an entire portfolio of products to handle the needs of just about any AI customer.This has translated into double- and triple-digit revenue growth quarter after quarter, and with margins surpassing 70%, a high level of profitability on sales. So Nvidia is winning when it comes to growth and ensuring profit. On top of this, the tech giant pledges to update its chips on an annual basis, and this commitment to innovation should keep it ahead of the crowd.Today, Nvidia shares are trading for 27 timesforward earnings estimates, down from 50 earlier this year. Considering Nvidia's earnings track record, market leadership, and plans to innovate, this looks like a golden opportunity to get in on this long-term stock.2. Palantir TechnologiesPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)offers customers an AI-driven platform to help them make better use of their data. Though this may sound mundane, it's actually just the opposite. Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is helping customers score major gains in efficiency and is positioning them to make game-changing decisions.Story ContinuesThe company has been most linked to government contracts over its 20-plus years in business, but in recent times, its commercial business has taken off -- today, both of these businesses are generating double-digit revenue growth. Palantir shares have fallen in recent weeks as investors fear cuts to the budget of the Pentagon -- a big customer -- could hurt revenue. But Palantir's ability to help customers gain in efficiency actually could result in additional government contracts and more revenue.And, in any case, the company's long-term prospects in both commercial and government markets look bright, making it a solid long-term buy -- especially since its forward PEG ratio has fallen to less than 1, suggesting it isn't overvalued.3. AlphabetAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)is using AI to make its top performing platform, and one that helps it generate billions of dollars in revenue, even better. I'm talking about Google Search, the world's leading search engine. Alphabet has developed its own large language model (LLM), Gemini, to improve search results and the experience for advertisers.But Gemini's power doesn't stop there. It's helping drive growth at Alphabet's cloud business, Google Cloud -- a unit that delivered revenue gains of 30% in the most recent quarter to $12 billion. Customers are flocking to Google Cloud for a variety of products and services as they build up their AI platforms. And since we're still in the early days of AI growth, this is likely to continue.Today, Alphabet is the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven stocks, the tech players that led market gains over the past two years. The stock trades at only 18 times forward earnings estimates, while most others trade in the range of 23 to 31. All of this makes it the top Magnificent Seven bargain to buy now.4. BroadcomBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO)is a networking giant, selling thousands of connectivity products that you'll find anywhere from your own home to a huge data center. And demand from AI customers has helped revenue soar in recent times.For example, in the latest quarter, Broadcom delivered a 77% increase in AI revenue to more than $4 billion, and infrastructure software revenue jumped 47% to $6.7 billion. The company predicts ongoing strong demand in the coming quarter as customers pile into Broadcom's XPU chips and connectivity products.Broadcom works closely with three major cloud service providers that it predicts will generate a serviceable addressable market of $60 billion to $90 billion in the 2027 fiscal year. And on top of this, the company is attracting business from other cloud providers -- two others recently chose Broadcom for custom accelerators to train advanced AI models.So, Broadcom, at 29 times forward earnings estimates down from more than 36 earlier in the year, offers investors a great entry point today.Image source: Getty Images.5. AmazonAI already is boosting earnings at e-commerce and cloud computing giantAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). The company uses the technology throughout its e-commerce business to gain in efficiency and better serve customers. And in its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), it offers a full portfolio of products and services to AI customers -- this helped AWS reach a $115 billion annual revenue run rate last year.Since AWS is the world's biggest cloud company, Amazon has access to an enormous number of potential AI customers -- and Amazon has structured its offerings to suit all of them. AWS offers premium Nvidia chips, but it also sells its own in house-designed chips for the cost-conscious customer. And it offers a fully managed service called Amazon Bedrock, which allows customers to adapt popular LLMs to their needs.Amazon is well positioned to gain as the AI market grows, and that means today, at 31 times forward earnings estimates, down from 45 last year,, it's a screaming buy.Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:TheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

On March 14, a key market day, Palantir, alongside Nvidia, led a tech stock rally, resulting in a notable uptick.

Discover why before your portfolio feels the trade war pinch.Over the last three years, Palantir Technologies achieved an impressive total shareholder return of nearly six times its initial value. This significant rise can be attributed to several key factors, including the rapid growth in earnings, which increased by 120.3% over the past year\u2014a pace that outstripped both the broader U.S. market and the software industry. Additionally, while Palantir's price-to-book ratio is high relative to industry and peer averages, this has not deterred investor interest.The company's corporate actions, such as its share buyback initiatives, further boosted shareholder confidence. For example, Palantir repurchased over 2.12 million shares for US$64.2 million, a move signaling robust financial health and commitment to enhancing shareholder value. Furthermore, Palantir's ambitious partnerships, such as the SAUR Group agreement and the deployment of AI technologies in sectors like healthcare and banking, highlight its extensive influence across industries, driving continued investor optimism.Are you invested in Palantir Technologies already?

{"article_id": "091500604", "title": "2 AI Stocks That Could Be Worth More Than Palantir by 2026", "content": "Shares ofPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)have had an incredible run the past few years. The stock has rocketed more than 1,000% since 2022, bringing its market cap (share price times total shares outstanding) to $195 billion at the time of writing.That market cap is high for a company with just $2.8 billion in trailing revenue and $462 million ofnet income. Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been all the rage on Wall Street, but even analysts can't overlook Palantir stock's expensivevaluation. The consensus rating on the shares is currently neutral (hold).There is significant downside risk in Palantir shares. Investors are paying an astronomical multiple of the company's sales and earnings that it may not be able to justify.Meanwhile, other AI stocks trade at more reasonable valuations and may outperform Palantir over the next year. Here are two promising stocks in the chip and software markets that could be worth more than Palantir by next year.1. Advanced Micro DevicesAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD)is a leading supplier of chips for consumer PCs, video game consoles, data centers, and other markets. It has a market cap of $158 billion and trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of about 21. Wall Street analysts expect AMD's earnings to grow 42% annually over the next several years.The stock has fallen 56% from previous highs over mixed financial results across its business segments over the past year. Strong revenue increases in the data center and client segments (PC chip sales) more than offset declines in AMD's gaming and embedded chip businesses, which is causing some uncertainty around AMD's near-term momentum.However, AMD is well positioned to continue growing its data center business. Data center revenue grew 69% year over year in the fourth quarter to reach $3.9 billion, or 51% of the business. In addition to growing demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used for AI workloads, AMD's EPYC central processing units (CPUs) gained share in the server market.AMD's GPUs are being used by several leading tech companies, includingMeta Platforms,Microsoft,DigitalOcean, andIBM. Management noted more AI design wins that will be deployed for its MI300 chip in the first half of 2025, while the new MI350 series should benefit from chip deployments to handle AI inferencing, where a trained model learns to make predictions on its own from new data. Inferencing will drive a lot of demand for AI chips going forward, and AMD could benefit tremendously.Story ContinuesMoreover, investors shouldn't overlook the gains AMD is making onIntelin the PC chip market, with client segment revenue up 58% year over year, reaching a record $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter. It was the fourth straight quarter of market share gains for AMD's Ryzen processors.The company's smaller businesses in gaming and embedded chips will eventually rebound, but there's enough momentum in data centers and the client segment to fuel solid returns for investors. AMD stock trades at a low forward P/E for a growth stock that may undervalue its potential in a growing semiconductor industry.2. ServiceNowServiceNow(NYSE: NOW)is a leading enterprise software company that has delivered consistent double-digit growth for several years. Corporations use ServiceNow to automate and streamline business processes. The stock has a market cap of $185 billion and a forward P/E of 56.Revenue grew at a compound annual rate of 32% over the last 10 years. It is gradually slowing as the business grows in size, but fourth-quarter subscription revenue growth was solid at 21% year over year. Management forecasts subscription revenue to increase between 18.5% to 19% year over year in Q1 2025.The company experienced expanding margins that are driving strong growth in adjusted earnings and free cash flow. On a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis, operating margin improved to 29.5% in 2024, and management is guiding for operating margin to reach 30.5% in 2025. The company should see margins continue to stretch higher as it achieves greater scale.A major catalyst that will fuel more revenue growth is adoption of AI agents, where software becomes smart enough to learn and complete tasks without human intervention.

(PLTR). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Right now, both SPX Technologies and Palantir Technologies Inc. are sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.SPXC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 22.37, while PLTR has a forward P/E of 149. We also note that SPXC has a PEG ratio of 1.24.

PLTR currently has a PEG ratio of 4.75.Another notable valuation metric for SPXC is its P/B ratio of 4.61. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, PLTR has a P/B of 36.94.These metrics, and several others, help SPXC earn a Value grade of B, while PLTR has been given a Value grade of F.Both SPXC and PLTR are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that SPXC is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The recent partnership with Ondas Holdings, which focuses on utilizing Palantir's Foundry platform to enhance the capabilities of Ondas's autonomous drone systems, aligns with the company's broader strategy of expanding its presence in real-time data analytics across multiple sectors. Other significant events during this period include the deployment of technological solutions at Societe Generale and a joint venture with TWG Global to drive AI deployment in financial services. On a broader market level, the tech rally led by companies like Tesla and Nvidia, driven in part by an encouraging CPI inflation report, has buoyed technology stocks, including Palantir.

This growth was supported by successful strategic partnerships, such as the collaboration with Voyager Technologies in March 2025 to bolster AI-powered solutions for space awareness.Additionally, corporate actions, including a share buyback totaling 2.12 million shares for US$64.2 million, played a role in Palantir\u2019s robust longer-term performance. Key financial milestones, like the company's rise in annual revenue from US$2.23 billion to US$2.87 billion by 2024, highlight the operational success underpinning this return.

{"article_id": "113000910", "title": "NASDAQ Correction: 2 AI Stocks That Aren't Worth Buying on the Dip", "content": "With theNasdaqindex in correction territory, many investors are trying to decide if it's a buying opportunity or if they should run for the hills. A correction is marked by an index declining 10% from its all-time high, which isn't quite as severe as a bear market. Additionally, stocks aren't necessarily a blanket buy or sell right now. Instead, I think there are certain ones that look like great bargains and others that still seem overvalued.Two stocks that I'm still not buying even after the sell-off areApple(NASDAQ: AAPL)andPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR). These are both incredibly popular stocks in the market, but I would need a further sell-off from them to consider buying, as they still have a very expensive price tag even after the drop.AppleApple is one of the most recognizable consumer brands in the world and built a strong ecosystem around its iPhones. However, Apple has struggled to launch a game-changing product over the past few years, and its sales have been flat since 2022.AAPL Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts.Although Apple's revenue is trending in the right direction, it's only projected to grow revenue by a mere 4.6% in fiscal year 2025 (ending around September 30). That's not quick growth by Apple and barely edges out the effect of inflation. In fact, Apple's $378 billion in revenue in January 2022 has the same buying power as $424 billion in December 2024 (when its last quarter ended), according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This means that Apple's growth over the past three years has fallen behind the rate of inflation, which isn't a good sign.Despite this, Apple still has a massive premium over its peers and the stock market.AAPL PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts.With the stock trading for nearly30 times forward earnings, it's still far more expensive than it has been for the better part of two years. It's also valued at nearly 50% higher than theS&P 500, which trades at 21.2 times forward earnings. While brand value deserves some recognition, Apple's growth is projected to be far below the average growth rate of the S&P 500 (10%), which is a big red flag for me.Furthermore, other members of the Magnificent Seven are valued at much lower price tags (likeAlphabetpriced at 18.6 times forward earnings,Meta Platformsat 24.4 times forward earnings, andNvidiaat 25.7 times forward earnings), despite growing at a much faster rate. Alphabet, Meta, and Nvidia grew revenue at an 11.8%, 20.3%, and 77.9% pace, respectively, in their most recent quarters. So it doesn't make a ton of sense to be buying Apple stock right now, as it's still highly priced. As a result, I'd rather look at some of Apple's peers than Apple itself.Story ContinuesPalantirPalantir is nearly the exact opposite of Apple in terms of growth. It makes AI-driven data analytics software used by both government and commercial entities. Its growth has been accelerating as the demand for its AI software ramps up, making Palantir one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street.PLTR Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth)data byYCharts.That growth is expected to persist, with management guiding for $860 million in revenue in the first quarter, indicating a 36% growth rate. Palantir's management has a track record of under-guiding and over-delivering, so don't be surprised if this growth rate reaches nearly 40% when it reports Q1 results.Despite this strength, Palantir's stock has fallen over 30% from its all-time high, but I don't think that decline is steep enough. The problem is that Palantir's stock is so highly valued that even 40% growth over the next four years doesn't justify the stock price.If Palantir could grow its revenue at a 40% pace over the next four years (Wall Street analysts expect 32% and 26% growth in 2025 and 2026, respectively), it would have revenue of $11 billion. While that's a large increase from the $2.87 billion in revenue it's generating right now, it still isn't enough from a profit standpoint.Palantir's current profit margin is about 16%, but let's say it can increase that to 30%, which would place it among the best software companies in terms of profit margin. It would generate $3.3 billion in profits if it can do that. Still, even after monster growth that nobody is projecting and industry-leading margins, Palantir's stock would still trade for 59 times forward earnings.That's a massive premium to pay for a stock, especially when you consider that the stock price can't budge from today's levels over the next four years to fulfill that projection.With so much growth already baked into Palantir's stock, it would have to fall a lot further before I'd consider taking a position in it.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:TheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

Let\u2019s take a closer look at recent results to get a better gauge on current demand trends and the broader outlook overall.NVDA Growth Remains RobustNVIDIA continues to be at the heart of the AI story thanks to its Data Center, which has provided unprecedented growth over recent years as companies continue to demand more computing power.As expected, Data Center results were the highlight of the latest print, which were again fantastic and overall reflective of a more than healthy demand backdrop.Data Center revenue totaled a record $35.6 billion, up more than 90% YoY and an impressive 16% sequentially. Notably, the reported figure beat out our consensus estimate by $2.0 billion, continuing its recent streak of outsized beats.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe valuation picture here remains highly attractive thanks to the outsized growth, with the current 1.0X PEG ratio sitting comfortably beneath the 2.5X five-year median and 5.5X five-year highs. The EPS outlook also continues to be notably bullish across the board, with the stock also sporting a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPalantir Customer Count SurgesPalantir\u2019s latest set of results came in strong as well, exceeding headline expectations and posting serious growth. Sales of $828 million shot 36% year-over-year and, more impressively, 14% sequentially. The strong sales growth was headlined by a 43% move higher in Customer count, reflecting the snowballing demand the company has been witnessing.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPalantir also closed a record-setting $803 million of U.S. commercial total contract value (TCV), which shot 130% higher year-over-year and 170% sequentially. U.S. results were jam-packed with positivity, with Commercial and Government revenue growing by 64% and 45%, respectively.Like NVDA, Palantir\u2019s EPS outlook continues to be bullish across the board, keeping the stock a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Earnings are forecasted to soar 31% in its current fiscal year on 32% higher sales.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe valuation picture for shares remains quite rich, with the current 4.7X PEG ratio undoubtedly residing on the steep end. Nonetheless, the current ratio is down significantly from the 7.2X high made just last month in February.Story ContinuesVertiv Raises Sales OutlookVertiv exceeded both consensus EPS and sales expectations in its print last month, with EPS soaring 77% on the back of a 26% move higher in sales. The growth rates here, particularly in sales, are reflective of very healthy underlying demand.Importantly, Vertiv upped its full-year 2025 sales guidance into a band of $9.1 - $9.3 billion, with the midpoint reflecting roughly 16% year-over-year growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, Vertiv\u2019s current fiscal year outlook remains bullish, with the current $3.59 per share consensus estimate suggesting 26% growth year-over-year. The stock boasts a bullish Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe valuation picture here remains favorable, similar to NVDA's, with the current 0.8X PEG ratio reflecting both growth and value. The current value matches the five-year median but remains well below 1.4X five-year highs.Bottom LineThe AI trade has gone sideways over recent weeks, with companies involved in the frenzy facing notable selling pressure.While the selling has undoubtedly been harsh, it\u2019s worth remembering that all three of these stocks \u2013 NVIDIA NVDA, Vertiv VRT, and Palantir PLTR \u2013 enjoyed tremendous runs over the past year, and the AI story remains fully intact.All three continue to sport a bullish EPS outlook, carrying favorable Zacks Ranks. Both NVIDIA and Vertiv are trading cheaply relative to historical levels, and Palantir\u2019s multiples have come off highs considerably over the past month.

{"article_id": "190634334", "title": "Why Palantir Stock Is Plummeting Today", "content": "Shares ofPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)are plummeting on Monday. The company's stock lost 11.1% as of 2:20 p.m. ET and was down as much as 12% earlier in the day. The drop comes amid broader market weakness, with theS&P 500down 2.8% and theNasdaq Compositedown 4.2%.The artificial intelligence (AI) and big data company is being hit by growing recession fears and comments by President Donald Trump.Recession worries intensifyConcerns about an economic downturn escalated following comments Trump made during an appearance onFoxNews'Sunday Morning Futures. When asked about the possibility of a recession, Trump responded, \"I hate to predict things like that,\" adding: \"There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America.\"The remarks did little to ease a fear that has permeated the market. Continued uncertainty in the face of trade tensions with America's largest trade partners, a shifting geopolitical landscape, as well as a possible government shutdown are putting pressure on stocks.Valuation questions persistPalantir's stock is especially volatile because it carries a hefty premium. Investors are willing to pay that premium based on the promise of outsize future returns, so when uncertainty arises, its stock is especially vulnerable.To put it lightly, the premium is not a small one. Even after its stock price has fallen 40%, its currentprice-to-earnings ratio (P/E)is nearly 450 -- an astronomical figure.I would avoid Palantir for now; its stock is just too expensive.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

{"article_id": "122000694", "title": "Should You Buy the Dip in Palantir Stock?", "content": "Over the last year, shares of enterprise software companyPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)have climbed by as much as 408%. While this suggests overwhelmingly bullish sentiment toward the company, more recent trends show a different picture.From Feb. 14 through Mar. 3, Palantir stock fell 33%. Let's explore what drove that sell-off and assess whether savvy investors shouldbuy the dip.Why is Palantir stock falling?There are only so many reasons investors may choose to sell a stock. For example, they may be locking in their gains following Palantir's historic performance in 2024, or they could be trimming their positions to raise capital prior to tax season.But Palantir's rapid decline came on the heels of an announcement from the White House. Specifically, President Trump ordered Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth towork with leaders at the Pentagon to identify areas where the defense budget could be trimmed.Given Palantir's largest customer by far is the U.S. government -- specifically, various defense and intelligence agencies -- investors saw the prospect of defense budget cuts as potential trouble for the company. While I can see why investors reacted negatively to this news, the sell-off is misguided.Image Source: Getty Images.Why the Palantir sell-off is misguidedIn my view, there are three big reasons Palantir's 33% drawdown has been unwarranted.The first revolves around big tech's work with the defense sector. Back in 2019, the Department of Defense created a program called the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI). At its core, this was a cloud infrastructure deal that was rumored to be worth up to $10 billion over the course of 10 years. Hyperscalers includingMicrosoft,Amazon, andAlphabet, as well as enterprise software giantOracle, bid on the contract.However, after some controversy around the bidding process, the Pentagon ultimately scrapped the entire contract in 2021.The Defense Department then created a new, similar program in 2022 called the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability (JWCC), and it awarded the contract jointly to all four of the companies above.Data byYCharts.As the graph above illustrates, from the time news broke regarding Trump's desire to cut the U.S. defense budget to the end of February, Palantir stock has seen much steeper losses than these four major tech companies with Pentagon contracts. The slide that big tech has been experiencing lately is likely due to hyperscalers' capital expenditures, not the President's plans for the Pentagon budget.This leads to what I see as the second thing putting pressure on Palantir stock. While the giants of big tech do a meaningful volume of business with public sector clients, they are far more diversified enterprises.Story ContinuesPalantir is regarded as primarily a government contractor. However, consider the chart below.Palantir Metric2021202220232024Government revenue as a percentage of total revenue58%56%55%55%Commercial revenue as a percentage of total revenue42%44%45%45%Data source: Palantir filings.Palantir still derives more than half of its revenue from the public sector -- a category that includes clients other than the U.S. government. But it has made strides over the last few years in its efforts to attract private sector clients. U.S. government revenue increased 45% year over year in the fourth quarter, and yet, the U.S. commercial segment still came out ahead with 64% growth.Finally, nothing specific has been decided about U.S. defense cost cuts yet. Some media outlets are reporting that the Defense Department has been told to find ways to reduce its budget by 8% annually -- roughly $50 billion per year -- so the money can be routed to President Trump's other priorities. However, there is also some chatter that the Pentagon won't necessarily be cutting its total spending but reallocating money from projects that are less related to the military's core mission to projects that are. If that turns out to be the case, I don't see quite as much risk for Palantir.Should you buy the dip in Palantir stock right now?Even though Palantir shares have cratered, the company's valuation remains extraordinarily elevated, even when compared to other high-flying software growth stocks.Data byYCharts.Still, this is a stock that doesn't experience such pronounced selling very often. For investors who remain bullish on Palantir's long-term prospects despite the looming threat of cuts at the Pentagon, this sell-off presents an attractive opportunity. That said, a careful approach, such as a dollar-cost averaging strategy, remains advisable.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

{"article_id": "221600136", "title": "Palantir Sank Today -- Is the Stock a Buy Right Now?", "content": "Palantir(NASDAQ: PLTR)stock got hit with another round of sell-offs in Tuesday's trading. The company's share price closed out the day's trading down 4% and had been off as much as 6.2% earlier in the session.Palantir's valuation pulled back today in conjunction with new bearish coverage from Jeffries. Brent Thill, the investment firm's lead analyst on the stock, published new coverage on Palantir this morning and maintained an underperform rating on the stock and a one-year price target of $60 per share. Based on Tuesday's closing price of $83.89 per share, Thill's target suggests additional downside of 28.5%.While Thill sang the praises of Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) after a recent conference showcasing the service, the Jeffries analyst raised concerns about the software specialist's valuation profile. Despite Palantir stock having pulled back 33% from its high, the company is still valued at roughly 150 times this year's expected earnings and 52 times expected sales. No matter how you slice it, that's a highly growth-dependent valuation.Is Palantir stock a buy right now?Palantir's heavily forward-looking valuation means the stock is probably not a good fit for investors without high risk tolerance. Some very strong sales and earnings growth is already priced into the stock, and shares could see a big pullback if business expansion comes in lower than anticipated or the macroeconomic backdrop takes a turn for the worse.On the other hand, Palantir looks to have built a clear leadership position in artificial intelligence (AI) software services for both public and private sector customers. The company's existing strengths are already helping it deliver fantastic sales growth and improved margins, and wins early in the AI race could build the foundations for massive success over the long term. So while Palantir is a risky stock, I think it will deliver strong returns for investors who take a buy-and-hold approach at today's prices.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The analysts added, \"This positive momentum is baked into PLTR's valuation at 45x CY26E, the most expensive stock in our coverage. Fundamentals have been strong, but valuation remains the biggest concern, and insiders continue to sell, with co-founder Stephen Cohen selling another $310M in shares over the past few days.\"The shares closed the day at $83.87, down 4% from previous close.The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Palantir?Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.What The Market Is Telling UsPalantir\u2019s shares are extremely volatile and have had 37 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.The previous big move we wrote about was 6 days ago when the stock gained 7% after the company revealed new commercial customers, including Walgreens Boots Alliance and Heineken. This signaled that Palantir's commercial business was gaining traction beyond its traditional government contracts. Signing up major names like Walgreens Boots Alliance and Heineken highlighted a shift that could help diversify its revenue streams.Analysts like Louie DiPalma of William Blair saw this as a sign that Palantir's commercial momentum remained strong. Investors would likely watch closely to see if this trend continues, as expanding in the private sector could be key to the company's long-term growth.Separately, markets experienced a boost after data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed that inflation for the month of February 2025 came in better than expected. The CPI rose 0.2% from the previous month (vs estimates for a 0.3% increase), while headline inflation rose 2.8% year on year (vs estimates for a 2.9% y/y increase). The data revealed inflation continued to edge closer to the Fed's 2% target, but not quite there yet. The reaction wasn't anything wild, but the sentiment leaned positive. The Nasdaq led the way, climbing 1.4%, boosting some tech stocks.Palantir is up 11.5% since the beginning of the year, but at $83.87 per share, it is still trading 32.7% below its 52-week high of $124.62 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Palantir\u2019s shares at the IPO in September 2020 would now be looking at an investment worth $8,828.Today\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy.

{"article_id": "093639766", "title": "The Best Growth Stocks to Buy in 2025", "content": "Competitively advantaged businesses set to benefit from the rapid growth of massive markets can be excellent investments. This is particularly true if you can buy them when their share prices are temporarily depressed.These two elite growth stocks are on sale today, but they likely won't be for long.Growth stock to buy No. 1: Palantir TechnologiesThe artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is advancing at lightning speed. Forward-thinking investors are starting to look beyond the suppliers of semiconductors and related infrastructure and turning their attention to innovative AI application providers.Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)stands among the elite in this rapidly expanding industry.Palantir helps its clients integrate cutting-edge data analytics andmachine learningtechnology into their daily operations. These tools strengthen its customers' capacity to synthesize information from a wide array of sources and derive actionable insights, often in real time.Palantir's offerings are in high demand among U.S. defense agencies. Palantir recently began delivering AI-powered intelligence-gathering systems to the U.S. Army. The Tactical Intelligence Targeting Access Node, or Titan, uses AI to collect sensor data and improve accuracy and decision-making.Titan brings powerful computing and communication tools to front-line personnel. It also highlights the rising usage of advanced software on the battlefield -- and the U.S. military's increased focus on strengthening its digital capabilities. These trends should continue to fuel Palantir's growth in the coming years.The commercial sector represents another vast opportunity for Palantir. Earlier this month, European financial giantSociete Generaledeployed Palantir's anti-financial-crime solutions to bolster its data integrity, security, and fraud-prevention processes. Additionally, Palantir recently launched a joint venture with TWG Global. The companies will work together to bring enterprise-grade AI to smaller banks, insurance providers, and other financial institutions.You can see more evidence of the soaring demand for Palantir's AI offerings in its financial reports. The software specialist's revenue climbed 29% to $2.9 billion in 2024. The gains were driven by a 30% jump in U.S. government sales and a 54% surge in U.S. commercial revenue.Moreover, Palantir's profit margins are expanding as its sales base swells. The AI software star's operating income ballooned to $310 million, up from $120 million in 2023.Palantir's stock is now trading at a roughly 30% discount to its 52-week high following the recent sell-off in the stock market. Some short-term traders are concerned that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's desire to reduce the defense budget could slow Palantir's expansion. However, with the Trump administration prioritizing efficiency, Palantir's cost-effective, software-based approach has it well positioned to take share from less AI-savvy competitors. That should enable Palantir to continue to grow its sales and profits, even if overall defense spending declines.Story ContinuesThus, long-term-focused investors might want to take advantage of the recent downturn in Palantir's share price -- and invest in the AI innovator's stock today.Growth stock to buy No. 2: NvidiaNvidia's(NASDAQ: NVDA)graphics processing units (GPUs) lie at the heart of the AI revolution. Yet while the AI colossus is enjoying red-hot demand for its powerful semiconductor chips, fearful traders have recently soured on its shares. That's presenting a compelling buying opportunity for patient, long-term investors.Tech juggernautsMicrosoft,Alphabet, andMeta Platformsare ramping up their spending on AI-related infrastructure to power their fast-growing cloud computing operations. These three companies alone have announced plans to invest a stunning $220 billion in 2025. Much of this AI-driven spending is set to flow into Nvidia's coffers in the years ahead.Nvidia's chips are considered best-in-class at training advanced AI models. Additionally, developers around the world have spent countless hours training on Nvidia's popular CUDA software, which enables them to program the tech giant's GPUs to execute a wide variety of tasks. The superiority of its chips and the time invested by developers into learning its software represent sizable switching costs for customers. In turn, these competitive advantages help to widen Nvidia's economic moat and protect its roughly 90% market share in AI data center GPUs.Still, fears of intensifying competition weigh on Nvidia's stock price. It's not often that a single company can maintain a greater than 80% share of a lucrative and rapidly expanding market, as Nvidia has with its advanced AI processors. Would-be rivalsAdvanced Micro DevicesandIntelhave yet to make much of a dent in Nvidia's sales. For context, AMD's stock price has lost almost half its value over the past year, and Intel just hired a new CEO. With its competitors stumbling, Nvidia's dominance of the booming AI chip market appears secured.Nevertheless, Nvidia's stock price is down about 20% from its 52-week highs. Its shares can currently be had for less than 27 times its projected earnings for its current fiscal year, which ends in January 2026. That's quite a bargain for a competitively dominant AI chipmaker that's expected to grow its profits by more than 47% during that period.Buying elite businesses when they're on sale is a proven recipe for success in the stock market.

{"article_id": "190500495", "title": "Here's Why Palantir Stock is a Buy Despite 26% Fall in a Month", "content": "Shares ofPalantir Technologies Inc.PLTR are down 26% from their record high on Feb. 18 and have mostly traded in the red over the past month. Palantir faced a recent decline despite being the market favorite for the past year with a 266.9% surge, outpacingNVIDIA Corporation\u2019s NVDA 33.8% gain. The stock was also the best S&P 500 performer in 2024.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSo, let\u2019s analyze the reasons behind this downturn, and why the Palantir stock is still a buy.Why is Palantir Stock Price Down in a Month?After its initial public offering boom in 2020, the Palantir stock gyrated for nearly four years. However, with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), Palantir shares rebounded. After all, generative AI is expected to help Palantir improve its data analytics competencies.But is generative AI boosting Palantir\u2019s growth? Before the introduction of ChatGPT, in 2020, Palantir\u2019s revenues jumped 47%. However, last year, Palantir\u2019s revenue growth rate slowed to 29%, suggesting generative AI didn\u2019t significantly benefit Palantir, and the stock remained susceptible to unwarranted events.Thus, when President Trump signed executive orders in the Oval Office last month, including a plan to reduce the defense budget by 8% annually for five years, the Palantir stock was undesirably impacted. This is because government clients in the United States constituted about 42% of Palantir\u2019s revenues in 2024.Reasons to be Bullish on Palantir StockDespite the recent setbacks in share price, there are many reasons to remain optimistic about the Palantir stock. The company\u2019s revenues in the fourth quarter jumped 36% from a year ago, and if Palantir sustains this growth, its revenues could nearly double in two years.In the fourth quarter, Palantir\u2019s revenues improved, banking on an uptick in customer base. The company increased its customer count by 43% from a year ago. Further, Palantir\u2019s expansion into the private sector beyond government clients will continue to boost its revenue growth. For the current year, Palantir expects its revenues to increase 31% year over year, way more than Wall Street estimates.Palantir\u2019s remaining performance obligation in the quarter ending on Dec. 31, 2024, exceeded the present revenue growth, indicating strong growth soon. High demand for Palantir\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) highlights expansion opportunities as it automates tasks beyond human capabilities.AIP\u2019s popularity has drawn both existing and new customers. Most importantly, with existing customers driving business, Palantir needs to spend less on revenue generation, thus boosting growth margins and potentially increasing the company\u2019s market capitalization.Story ContinuesPalantir Stock is a Must-Buy NowWith Palantir\u2019s shares well-poised to eventually gain strength in the near term, banking on an increase in customer bases and AIP\u2019s acceptance, it is worth buying the stock now. If the firm establishes itself in the expanding generative AI market, PLTR\u2019s stock price may significantly increase over the next decade.Palantir, rightfully, has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with an expected earnings growth rate of 36.6% this year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents for PLTR\u2019s earnings per share (EPS) is up 40% from a year ago.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

{"article_id": "201250498", "title": "Is Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) Best Software Stock to Buy According to Billionaires?", "content": "We recently published a list of10 Best Software Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other best software stocks to buy according to billionaires.The software industry has firmly established itself as one of the most resilient and fastest-growing sectors in the global economy. As digital transformation continues to expand across various industries, businesses are increasingly relying on software solutions to enhance efficiency, support seamless growth, and foster innovation. The rising focus on automating workflows, improving customer experiences, and leveraging data-driven insights has sustained the high demand for software products.What\u2019s Driving Software GrowthEric Compton, an equities strategist for Morningstar Research Services, underscored artificial intelligence and digital transformation as major drivers for growth in his Industry Outlook published on March 11. He projected consistent revenue and margin growth for the software sector, with total industry revenue anticipated to rise at an annual rate of 11% through 2029. Key factors supporting this growth include high customer retention due to switching costs, significant initial investments that translate into steady revenue streams, and sustained demand for digital transformation. Compton also identified AI adoption, increasing data requirements, and the shift to cloud-based solutions as central drivers for growth, while cautioning against potential challenges like higher interest rates, economic uncertainties, and regulatory issues.The Morningstar strategist further emphasized that despite short-term fluctuations, the long-term demand for software remains strong, particularly in database software and customer experience applications, which are expected to grow at the fastest rate. Software companies gain an advantage from substantial upfront investments in R&D and customer acquisition, which lead to long-lasting, high-value client relationships. Compton also underlined the fact that most firms in the sector possess strong competitive advantages, or \u201cmoats,\u201d primarily due to switching costs and network effects. Once a company adopts a software solution, shifting to a competitor is complex, ensuring a stable revenue stream. Although IT spending has normalized following the pandemic, ongoing automation, AI-driven advancements, and customer-oriented software solutions are expected to fuel sustained growth in the sector.Opportunities in the Software MarketRecent performance in the global software industry has been marked by volatility. Jason Hunter, JP Morgan\u2019s Head of Technical Strategy, shared insights in a January interview with CNBC, highlighting trends in the software and semiconductor sectors. He noted that while semiconductor stocks led market growth in 2024, the software sector gained momentum later in the year but underperformed in December. This pullback brought the valuation ratios of both large- and small-cap software stocks back to their breakout levels relative to semiconductors, offering a more favourable risk-reward scenario for software investments.Story ContinuesIn conclusion, despite recent volatility and macroeconomic risks, the software sector remains an attractive space for investors due to its promising long-term outlook. Ongoing investments in cloud technology, AI, and digital transformation are expected to drive growth, with segments like database software, customer experience tools, and cybersecurity anticipated to expand at a faster pace. Companies that adapt to emerging technological trends, maintain strong customer retention, and use AI to drive innovation are likely to achieve the greatest success in the future.Our MethodologyTo determine the 10 best software stocks to buy according to billionaires, we shortlisted the top 10 enterprise and application software stocks most favoured by billionaire investors, leveraging Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 database on billionaire holdings.

She later completed a Master of Business Administration in finance at USC\u2019s Marshall School of Business. A key influence in her academic journey was economist Arthur Laffer, known for the Laffer Curve, which theorizes the relationship between tax rates and tax revenue.

Her pioneering move involved structuring actively managed investment strategies as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), an industry-first approach that allowed a broader range of investors to participate in emerging technologies.\u00a0She recognized that investing in such transformative technologies requires active management to navigate rapid changes, an open research ecosystem unrestricted by sectors, geographies, or market capitalizations to capture technological convergence, and the sharing of knowledge to deepen understanding of emerging industries.

I want to get started by welcoming you to our quarterly conference call. We appreciate you joining us today and for your continued interest in Ondas.I'm happy to be joined today by key members of our leadership team, including Neil Laird, our Interim CFO; and Meir Kliner, President of Ondas Autonomous Systems and the Founder and CEO of our Airobotics subsidiary, both whom are very familiar to you.We're also joined by two new members of our leadership team for their first investor called Ondas. Of course, I am speaking about Oshri Lugassi, our new Co-CEO of Ondas Autonomous Systems; and Markus Nottelmann, the new CEO of Ondas Networks.I'm excited to have Markus and Oshri here with us. They bring exceptional leadership and industry experience that is sure to be invaluable. Further, both have been known to Ondas for a while now and are already making an impact in the field with customers. You'll hear more about these two leaders later in the call.So let's now turn to the agenda. I'll begin with a review of our key highlights from 2024 and provide an outlook for 2025, where we anticipate a record year of revenue growth primarily driven by Ondas. I will also share some important details on the partnership we announced yesterday with Palantir.Neil will then walk through our financial results for the fourth quarter in full year 2024. And after that we will provide a business update where I will ask Markus, Oshri, and Meir to provide their perspective on the progress within our Ondas Networks and OAS business units. Then, I will wrap the call and move to take investor questions.2024 was a defining year for Ondas, marked by pivotal milestones that sets the stage for accelerated growth in 2025 and beyond. It was also marked by overcoming challenges, and I am extremely proud of our teams across Ondas.Recall that early in 2024, we faced the challenges of extending timelines on this networks and of course the war activities in Israel, which place pressure on our operating capabilities.Nonetheless, we persevered through these challenges. We firmly established our presence in the global defense market, securing two major programs of record with a key military customer in the Middle East for both our Optimus and Iron Drone Raider platforms. These programs validate or dual use autonomous drone technology and have also dramatically increased both our TAM and the serviceable and obtainable market or SAM, and they're expected to increase the velocity of our business at OAS.Iron Drone radar is now positioned as the market defining platform for low kinetic county UAS in the mitigation of drone threats, needing the critical need for drone interception in contested environments. This market is seeing massive demand growth, and we believe our opportunity is to position Iron Drone as a category owner.We recently announced that we have launched an Iron Drone demo team which has already begun to engage customers globally. And we are already seeing tangible activity with additional military and homeland security customers. We're engaging with these new defense and homeland security customers through government to government channels as well as through our own direct marketing efforts.As Meir will share, we have similarly engaged with new customers around our Optimus system, which is now being deployed to secure military bases and border checkpoints, demonstrating the exceptional capabilities of this market leading system and high value security markets in both defense and critical industrial markets.Beyond our commercial traction, we invested significant energy to enhance operational efficiencies to scale our growth, ensuring we are positioned to meet demand. That includes furthering the development of our supply chain and field services capabilities.Enhancing our operational platform is a perpetual focus for us and will be critical as we drive growth across technology platforms, geographies, and end markets. Despite the lack of revenue traction on those networks, we further solidified our position in technology network road maps for our customers, which of course includes Amtrak, but also broadening our engagement with new industry and ecosystem partners.We close the year with a $10 million backlog primarily with OAS, reinforcing the strength of our pipeline and the visibility we now have on future revenue. That backlog and buttressed by a growing invisible order book. This gives us confidence in projecting at least $20 million in revenues from OAS. It supports the total revenue expectations of $25 million for Ondas Holdings in 2025.Recall that we originally set expectations for 2025 revenue at $15 million to $18 million for OAS at our investor day in September 2024. And I stated that we want to set conservative expectations, which we will strive to beat at that time. This remains the case with our updated outlook today, which I will touch on in some more detail at the end of today's call.We also fortified our capital position, raising $35 million in Q4 alone, which met the goals we articulated back in our last investor update. This provided us with a strong liquidity position and financial runway to execute our expansion strategy with confidence.Ondas enters 2025 stronger than ever with a clear runway for growth and defense, homeland security, and critical infrastructure security markets.As we look ahead, 2025 is set to be an acceleration year for Ondas, with momentum building from our execution in 2024, we believe we are positioned to deliver record revenue as we scale our existing programs and expand into new customer opportunities.We have the following key objectives for 2025. Firstly, we tend to drive growth with existing programs and customers. We are intensely focused on executing and expanding on existing programs with Optimus and Iron Drone, ensuring successful deployments is sustained customer adoption.As we build on what we have, we plan further expansion through new customer programs. Our defense and homeland security engagements in Israel and the UAE provide a strong foundation for broader adoption. From here, we expect to secure multiple additional military customers in 2025, leveraging both G2G channel opportunities in addition to Ondas's direct marketing efforts.We believe these efforts will be enhanced with Oshri's leadership based on his demonstrated success in securing over $20 million -- $20 billion in defense contract sales by leading the go to market strategy at one of Israel's most important global defense companies.Of course, we will also look to pull through on our existing pipeline with critical infrastructure and public safety customers in the US and Europe, which also presents substantial growth opportunities.We intend to continue to invest to scale our operating platform. We're building a scalable infrastructure with investments in supply chain, sustainment, and field services to support long-term customer adoption. These activities will have the benefit of leveraging our new partnership with Palantir, whereby they are providing their foundry AI systems for enterprise resource, efficiencies, which I will stand upon in a moment.Lastly, we intend to build further build strategic value at on this networks, despite timeline challenges. We continue to believe in both the long-term opportunity data on networks and the strategic value of the business, and we are intent on realizing that value.Recall the private wireless is a platform to create value along the technology ecosystem at the edge of rail operations. The capacity and flexibility to drive new applications supporting advanced intelligent safety and operating systems is strategically valuable for both our rail customers and the large rail edge technology vendors.Under Markus's leadership, we expect to see broader customer and partner engagement, ensuring continued progress in 900 megahertz rail network deployments while exploring additional product and network opportunities.With a strengthened leadership team, validated market traction, and a robust pipeline, Ondas is poised for transformative growth in 2025. As the year progresses, I believe a deeper customer pool, a growing order book and backlog, and our continuous focus on operational scale will support a growth flywheel.With proper execution, this will be a year when our investments in technology, operations, and market expansion deliver tangible results for our customers and our investors.Yesterday, we announced a strategic partnership with Palantir Technologies, a leading provider of AI systems. I'm very excited about engaging with Palantir and the breadth of great capabilities and solutions they bring to the markets we care about.This is an incredibly important relationship which we have established with significant long-term benefits to Ondas. Initially, we will leverage Palantir's Foundry AI platform to scale OAS's operating platform in support of our revenue ramp.With foundry, we aim to unify data and streamline operations which will help enable scalable adoption of our Optimus system and Iron Drone Raider globally. This entails connecting to our supply chain production, as well as our field services and sustainment activities with customers across the world.This will also ultimately extend to our product and solutions development where we are likely to create further AI enabled advancements in our platform capabilities in support of evolving custom requirements for autonomy and data intelligence.I believe Palantir see similar scope for product and market development as we advance our relationship. I expect this partnership to ultimately be a force multiplier across a number of important facets of our business and look forward to sharing more details as we begin to integrate foundry, eventually other talented AI capabilities into our business.I will now hand the call to Neil to provide a detailed financial update. Neil?Story ContinuesNeil LairdThank you, Eric. As I get started, I want to remind our investors that our financial statements reflect the early stage of platform adoption for both Ondas Networks and OAS and the preparation for larger commercial rollouts.We expect significant operating leverage as revenues grow, for today's revenue levels do not yet cover our operating expenses. For Ondas Networks, revenues will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, given the uncertainty around the timing of customer activity in front of the targeted commercial rollouts of the 900 megahertz network and the development programs underway with Siemens and MXV rail.Similarly, revenues at OAS are expected to vary from quarter to quarter and normalize into a more predictable pattern as we grow our customer base, and more of those customers enter fleet programs and recurring service agreements in the United States and internationally.Revenues increased 173% to $4.1 million quarter over quarter for the three months ending December 31, 2024. Compared to $1.5 million for the three months ending September 30, 2024. And we're down 18% from $5 million for the three months ending December 31, 2023.Revenues from Ondas Networks were $0.5 million, relatively flat compared to the third quarter of 2024, and down $1.1 million from the fourth quarter of 2023. This was primarily a result of extended timelines related to the 900 megahertz activity with the Class I railroads.OAS revenues were $3.6 million an increase of $2.6 million or 260% from the third quarter of 2024, and an increase of 10% from the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase reflects the shipment of products and services from the $14.4 million in orders, primarily related to the two new programs secured with a military customer in the third quarter of 2024.Gross profit was $0.9 million or 22% for Q4 2024, as opposed to $0.1 million or 3% for the third quarter of 2024 and $1.7 million or 35% for the fourth quarter of 2023. The increase in gross margins from the third quarter results from increased product revenue at OAS.Compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, the decrease reflects the lack of higher margin product sales at Ondas Networks and slightly lower margins at OAS because of the inclusion of third-party products in the current quarter revenue.Gross margins can be volatile on a quarter to quarter basis, due to revenue levels that reflect the early stage of platform adoption and shifts in revenue mix between product development and service revenues.Operating expenses decreased to $9.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2024, as opposed to $8.7 million in the third quarter of 2024 and $14.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. The decrease from the prior year was primarily due to a $4.0 million non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2023 and various cost savings implemented in 2024 at Ondas Networks. The increase from the third quarter was primarily the result of a credit loss charge in the current quarter.Cash operating expenses were $7.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $8.7 million in the third quarter of 2024. These exclude non-cash operating expenses for depreciation and amortization of $1.2 million in both quarters, stock-based compensation of $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, and impairment of long-term assets charge of $4 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.The operating loss was $8.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to $12.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $7 million for the fourth quarter, about the same as the $7 million for the fourth quarter of 2023.For the full year of 2024, revenues were $7.2 million as opposed to $15.7 million for the full year 2023. This was largely due to extended timelines at Ondas Networks and war-related disruptions in Israel for OAS that impacted operations, particularly in the first half of 2024.Gross profit was $0.3 million for the full year 2024, as compared to $6.4 million for the full year of 2023, reflecting lower revenue compared to fixed operations costs, particularly at OAS. We expect margins to recover in 2025 with higher revenues and improved scale from larger production volumes at OAS.Operating expenses for the full year of 2024 were $35.0 million as compared to $46.1 million for the full year of 2023. The reduction was due to the absence of one-time non-cash charges of $4 million in 2024, achieving the full savings from the integration of American robotics and air robotics operations to form OAS that was implemented during 2023, and additional cost savings achieved at Ondas Networks during 2024.Cash operating expenses were $28.9 million for the full year of 2024, a decline of $7.2 million from 2023. This was due to the OAS integration mentioned previously and cost savings achieved at Ondas Networks. Adjusted EBITDA with our loss was $28.5 million for 2024, as compared to $29.7 million for 2023.So now let's turn to the cash flow statement. We held cash of $30 million as of December 31, 2024, compared to $15 million as of December 31, 2023. The full year cash provided by financing includes additional financing totalling $50.2 million of which $35.3 million occurred in the fourth quarter.Ondas Holdings received proceeds from convertible loans of $28.3 million. OAS received $5.1 million and Ondas Networks received $1.9 million.Cash used in operations during the full year decreased slightly to $33.5 million. Investments in working capital accounted for $4.8 million of its usage compared to $3.9 million in 2023.We expect cash utilization to improve in 2025. Improved cash efficiency comes from operating expense leverage at our OAS business unit, given our expectation of a recovery in revenue and gross profit growth over the course of '25 and continued cost controls across the company.The company expects to fund its operations from cash on hand of $30 million as of December 31, 2024 from gross profits achieved from revenue growth, potential pre-payments from customers for purchase orders, and potential proceeds from warrants issued and outstanding, and additional funds are needed that the company may seek through equity or debt offerings and borrowings under additional notes payable, lines of credit or other sources.As of December 31, 2024, Ondas Holdings had $52 million in debt outstanding. $9.6 million of this balance has been converted into equity during the first quarter of 2025. $6.2 million of Ondas Holdings convertible debt matures in April of 2025, a further $12 million in July of 2025, and the balance of $24.9 million in December of 2026.We have been focused on maintaining liquidity to fund our growth plan and raised a further $0.9 million in convertible notes at Ondas Networks in January. We have also established a relationship with [Claire], a working capital provider to allow us to factor receivables as needed. We also anticipate that the maturing notes will either be converted into equity or will have their terms extended.And I will now hand the call back to Eric.Eric BrockThank you, Neil. Now we will transition to a review of our business units and ask Markus, Oshri, and Meir to share updates on business development activity and operations at Ondas Networks and OAS.As I hand the call the Markus to provide a business update for Ondas Networks, I want to reiterate how excited we are to add this level of talent to our management team. Markus brings deep experience in railroad operations, industrial technology, and strategic finance.In addition to financial and strategic roles within the private equity industry, his experience included senior leadership positions at Sperry Rail Service and Acuren Inspections, subsidiaries of Rockwood Holdings. There he focused on integrating new technologies into railroad markets and was instrumental in driving improved operational efficiency and revenue velocity.These experiences are highly relevant and complimentary to the exceptional technical talent at Ondas Networks, enabling us to drive deeper conversations with customers and business partners. I am very confident that Markus is the right person to help us drive the adoption of our dot16 technology across rail networks. Markus, welcome to the call. The floor is yours.Markus NottelmannThank you, Eric. And I start, I want to say simply that I'm happy to join on those networks, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to work with you and the board, as well as with Guy Simpson, our COO, and the extremely talented team we have it on those networks.I believe we have an exceptional technology platform with our dot16 system, and we also have extremely valuable expertise in industrial networks, which of course extends to the railroad communications.Together with -- together, this has the promise of creating significant value for both our railroad customers and the broader rail technology ecosystem. Of course, we have a lot of work ahead of us to drive adoption and leverage the significant efforts we have made to create business development opportunities.With that introduction, it's great to join you today to provide you with a review of key developments at Ondas Networks in 2024. And how we are positioning ourselves for '25.While we continue to support the railroad industry with their specific 900 megahertz network needs, we are also positioning Ondas Network's robust technology platform to address the railroad's broader communication needs.I will expand on this in a moment, but first I'll provide an update on our specific activities and outlook for the 900 megahertz network. In 2024, one of our distribution partners, Siemens Mobility, received and fulfilled an order from Metra, the primary commuter rail system in Chicago for a system-wide upgrade of their 900 megahertz network.This project includes the migration of the network to the new A-Block channels and the introduction of 802.16 to support IP applications.In addition to Metra, a Class I railroad has also deployed and is operating a live 900 megahertz system with the airing equipment in the Chicago area. Both of these infrastructure upgrades highlight the seamless upgrade process associated with our technology and the benefits to be gained from the dot16 platform.Rather than continue to operate their silo communications platforms as is, multiple Class Is are evaluating the possibility of having the 900 and 220 megahertz networks act as backups for the critical systems that run in each of these networks.Specifically, there's an interest in extending the new 900 megahertz network from its primary use of transporting legacy centralized train control traffic to providing a backup for the positive train control applications operating on the 220 megahertz network.This strategy adds resiliency, redundancy, and diversity to critical railroad coming operations by eliminating single points of failure. We're supporting various Class Is in their evaluations and based on the results to date, expect that this strategy will be adopted for network rollout by at least several Class Is.The Class I railroads through the AAR has communicated on several occasions at the end of last year and earlier this year that the Class Is are firmly committed to meet the 900 megahertz transmission satellites as well as the related buildout timeline.The railroad's communication needs extend far beyond the 900 megahertz network. Just as our customers are beginning to examine their broader communication needs, we intend to bring our capabilities to bear in providing holistic communication solutions.In the 220 megahertz band, we continue to execute on the new PTC data radio program for Amtrak in the Northeast Corridor. The first prototype radios were delivered to Amtrak in Q3, and the development activity is on track to be completed in Q1.We expect deliveries of the new 220 megahertz radios to begin in the second quarter of 2025, with the subsequent rollout to other operators in the Northeast Corridor.In the 450 megahertz band, we are making steady progress with next generation head of train end of train technology. Testing of our communications technology is complete, and we're working with several head of train end of train equipment manufacturers on integrating our technology. We expect that this will lead to commercialization at the end of 2025.Next generation head of train, end of train, or NGHE is critical to the railroad industry to ensure significant improvement in safe train operations as well as to enable operations of longer trains.Both NGHE and the Northeast Corridor work highlight on this networks breadth and depth and communication expertise. Our goal for 2025 is to work directly with the Class Is and other industry stakeholders to address broad industry communication needs and provide solutions for long-standing industry challenges.Since the beginning of the year, we have engaged with several Class Is and other industry stakeholders on topics related to large volume data transmission and railroad operations. This is an industry-wide topic with significant implications for safety, operational continuity, and capital spend.The railroad operating environment presents some significant challenges, rendering off the shelf technology irrelevant. The Class Is are looking to on those networks to provide comprehensive solutions that overcome these challenges.We are applying our broad expertise to design, develop, and commercialize solutions that address these real communication needs of the Class Is. We look forward to updating you on this topic throughout 2025.I will now hand the call back to Eric.Eric BrockThank you, Markus. I will now ask Oshri Lugassi to take the floor and share his thoughts on the opportunities ahead at OAS. As I do, I want to say once again how thrilled we are to have him join Ondas. Oshri brings several decades of leadership experience in military operations and autonomous systems, having served with great acclaim with the Israeli Defense Forces, where he commanded over 30,000 personnel.Prior to joining Ondas, Oshri served as Vice President of Marketing at Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. At Rafael, he had prolific success leading the marketing and execution of critical security capabilities totaling over $20 billion in government to government defense contract sales and helped grow Rafael's defense technology footprint globally.His industry relationships with defense ministries, military forces, and intelligence agencies worldwide are sure to be hugely valuable as Ondas continues to expand into defense and homeland security markets. After Oshri's comments, he will hand the call to Meir Kliner, who will provide a detailed update on the business development progress at OAS. Oshri, please proceed.Oshri LugassiThank you, Eric, and I also want to thank you and the board for the opportunity to join the team and advance the important work we are doing together, and I am also happy to join the call and engage with our investors in this forum.Let me begin by sharing that I joined Ondas Autonomous Systems because I believe. The future of defense is rooted in systems that autonomous, intelligent, and built for real world operations. Having spent years working on government to government defense programs, I've seen firsthand how critical advanced technology is protecting people. Defense isn't just about equipment. It's about delivering reliable, field proven solutions that support those on the front lines and strengthen national security.Global threats are evolving at an unprecedented pace and traditional defense systems cannot keep up. There is an urgent need for AI-driven autonomous solutions that can operate 24/7, integrate seamlessly with allied forces. Ondas is uniquely positioned as a leader in autonomous defense technology, bringing combat proven AI driven solutions to allied forces.With our advanced platform and operational expertise, we are poised to shape the future of modern warfare and strengthen national security. At the core of our success is the talent and expertise of our teams at a robotics in Israel and American robotics in the US. These teams bring decades of experience in developing and deploying autonomous technologies, ensuring that we deliver not just innovation, but real world capabilities that defense forces can trust.Looking ahead, my vision is clear. We will become one of the leading next generation defense technology providers. Delivering autonomous systems that enhance security operations and provide real tactical adventures.Our ability to operate across both US and allied defense ecosystems gives us strategic edge, as we work closely with government agencies, security forces and defense partners to deploy mission critical solutions where they are needed most. We are not just adapting to the future. We are shaping with practical results driven solutions that protect people and secure nations.So I am thrilled to be here and working with a strong team. We are fully committed to both our mission and to delivering great outcomes for our investors.I will now hand over the call to Meir, who will give you a detailed update on our activities. I look forward to the quarters and years ahead with all of you. Thank you.Meir KlinerThank you, Oshri. It is great to have you here with us today. I look forward to seeing your leadership at OAS help us drive the expansion of our business in the defense and homeland security sectors.2024 was a remarkable year for Ondas Autonomous Systems. We established a new business around our cutting edge county drone system, the Iron Drone Raider, secured our first deal with a strategic defense customer for our legacy system, Optimus, and have already begun deploying these orders in a real world operational environment.In the US market, American robotics made significant progress in expanding our footprint and strengthening relationships with strategic partners. We launched our training and demo center in Maryland, successfully conducted demonstrations, and obtained designated waivers and unique technological approvals to enable fully autonomous behind visual line of sight flights.Outside of America, we continued scaling our drone network in Dubai while expanding our business into Europe and Asia, developing key relationships with customers and strategic partners.In Europe, we secured multiple agreements with local distributors and integrators and conducted real world demonstrations of both the Iron Drone and the Optimus Systems. These activities have already resulted in significant business development progress, and we look forward to sharing more details on our business progress in this country soon.The nature of modern warfare, as seen in recent global conflicts is rapidly involving creating new demands for both defensive and offensive technologies. OAS is in a unique position with both Optimus and Iron Drone Raider undergoing accelerated upgrades and rigorous testing in real world combat environments.We closed 2024 with significant deals involving key customers with strong expansion potential in 2025 and beyond through government to government agreements and multi-million dollar opportunities in the global defense market driving by the next generation warfare and cutting edge defense technology.The robotics is currently focused on fulfilling major military and defense contracts, enhancing our products with next generation capabilities, meeting defense specific operational needs and deploying our systems according to plan.Our initial platform Optimus stands out in the market for its maturity, scalability, and advanced capabilities. Unlike first generation one in a box solutions that struggled with automated landing, battery and pilot swapping, and fully automated data handling, Optimus has already surpassed these challenges.It operates autonomously, even in disconnected environments without reliance on internet connectivity or external networks. Our defense customers recognize Optimus as a scalable platform as we are actively collaborating to integrate advanced AI driven autonomy to make it truly unstoppable in emission critical scenarios.Iron Drone Raider has been tested and refined with real world operational feedback, making it in the most versatile and mature countdown inter sector on the market today. We are continuously integrating it with other advanced defense systems and enhancing its features through a designated program with our defense partners.I am confident that we will soon witness additional breakthroughs and new capabilities that will further strengthen our position as a leader in next-gen autonomous defense technology.During 2024, we managed to fulfil most of our business development targets, creating our marketing infrastructure in targeting regions and sectors. In the US market, American Robotics completed the establishment of its customer demonstration and training center at its new Maryland headquarters, supporting the introduction of Optimus and Iron Drone Raider to the defense, public safety, and critical infrastructure sectors.In addition, the Optimus System was showcased through multiple BVLOS demonstrations, including New York, Texas, and Massachusetts, providing its ability to execute fully autonomous missions without an on-site pilot or visual observer. Our marketing activity at American Robotics is gaining traction and our customer pipeline is maturing.I am happy to report today that we have received a purchase order from a large US water utility based on the east coast where we will deploy an Optimus System along with our Kestrel Aerospace awareness system. The Optimus System will be used to secure important water resources in support of the local community, and we believe this program could expand from here.American Robotics integrated the Kestrel system, and advanced airspace monitoring solution combining active and passive detection technologies with air traffic situational awareness software. This system meets regulatory detect and avoid the requirements, enabling behind visual line of site operations and fully autonomous one's missions.A BVLOS waiver was achieved, allowing for flights over people and moving vehicles, further expanding American Robotics operational capabilities. We also executed a contract with the US Coast Guard maritime emission monitoring, supporting EPA Clean Port initiatives at the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach. This milestone positions American Robotics as a prime vendor for US federal agencies.In the Middle East, we have expanded our business footprint and continued our project in Dubai and Israel, our Optimus networks in this region performing hundreds of flights every week, completely autonomously, 24/7 over populated urban areas.We are very excited to see this level of operational maturity in the Optimus System, and we will soon have more news on scaling up our drone network in Dubai and additional locations. In Europe, we have partnered with HHLA Sky and C-Astral Aerospace, expanding our reach into key markets such as Germany and Slovenia.We conducted multiple demonstration of Optimus and Iron Drone Raider for key customers and partners, reinforcing a robotics growing market presence in the region. We recently announced the launch of our Iron Drone demo team in Europe, and we are already seeing strong engagement and positive results, which we believe will lead to important commercial activity in 2025.We have also announced that Ondas and Volatus Aerospace formed a strategic partnership to enhance border surveillance, utilizing advanced and drone technologies, reinforcing OAS's role in security and defense applications.I would like to thank all of our teams in the Robotics and American Robotics. I believe we are making very significant progress. In the last year and as 2025 started, we have witnessed big changes in the world, in the market and within our company. Every day, we see our systems getting better and conversations with more top customers. I'm looking forward to sharing some more news with you soon.I will now hand over the call to Eric so he can provide the outlook for 2025.Eric BrockThank you, Meir. Let's now turn to our outlook. I am excited for Ondas and believe 2025 will see accelerated growth, leveraging the momentum from our successes in 2024. So let me set that stage for you. Our key objectives at OAS include driving growth through the expansion of our ongoing Optimus and Iron Drone programs with our current military and public safety customers, ensuring successful deployments and further customer adoption.We also plan to expand new customer programs, particularly in the defense and homeland security sectors and aim to secure additional military customers through both governance and government channels and direct marketing. Similarly, we are focused on leveraging our dual-use capabilities across critical infrastructure and public safety sectors to capture new customers in the US and in Europe.To support this growth, we will continue to invest in scaling our operating platform with a focus on supply chain and field services and leveraging our new partnership with Palantir to enhance efficiencies through AI. At Ondas Networks, we are committed to building strategic value by advancing private wireless networks for critical rail operating and safety systems.As Markus highlighted, that entails driving the 900 megahertz build-out as well as broadening the use cases at the edge, which will include additional applications on 900 megahertz as well as the other private rail bands, including the new systems such as NGHE at 450 megahertz.Given the building momentum at Ondas, we expect to generate record revenues for 2025. This is supported by a significant backlog we bring into the year and visibility we have on the order intentions of customers. Indeed, our business development pipeline is expanding, and we also expect a record year for bookings and backlog growth.For the full year, we expect to generate $25 million in revenue across Ondas business units. We believe this is a conservative forecast. For OAS, we are raising our revenue outlook to at least $20 million as compared to our initial $15 million to $18 million given at our OAS Investor Day in September 2024.We want to carefully manage expectations at Ondas Networks due to the lack of tangible orders in hand today. For now, we have a conservative outlook expecting just $5 million in revenue for 2025. Of course, these numbers would change dramatically to the upside with the network build-out, which I believe is inevitable.For some more context on the outlook, when sharing targets, our objective is to provide as much transparency as we can when setting expectations on financial performance. There is always risk in providing revenue targets, but it is important to help our investors evaluate both our potential and performance.Simply put, we believe these revenue targets are conservative. We are targeting huge markets with proprietary and valuable platform technologies. We're engaging with various customers at both OAS and Ondas Networks who could enter into and expand programs around our platforms that could substantially increase this outlook.Of course, that is our goal, and I hope we will be able to do that in 2025. With a strengthened leadership team and validated market traction, I believe we are poised for significant growth supported by a robust pipeline and a focus on operational scale. We are focused on delivering for our customers and for you, our investors. To sum it up, we are executing our vision to scale Ondas, and I believe 2025 will be a breakout year.With that said, let's see if there are any questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperatorGlenn Mattson, Ladenburg Thalmann.Glenn MattsonYeah. Hey guys, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the progress at OAS. Nice to see the $10 million of backlog coming into the year. Can you just give us some more color on your visibility into the number you provided at least $20 million. A couple of things like just the timing of how you see that kind of when you expect orders to come in, in order to get them shipped and out this year? And then also generally the mix that you envision between Optimus and Iron Drone.Eric BrockSure, Glenn. Thanks for the question. So bringing the $10 million into this year, we expect that to be realized and recognized in revenue in the first and second quarter. And we are actively engaged with various customers, both on the military side, new customers that is, for new programs with Iron Drone as well as customers on Iron Drone and Optimus who are looking to expand programs, and that specifically is with our major military customer in the Middle East and of course, our public safety customer in Dubai.Glenn MattsonOn the Dubai customer, can you give us an update on had you shipped any units in Q4? And maybe just a general sense of how many you expect in '25 or if --Eric BrockYeah. I'm not able to share specific details on that, but there's an active and advanced dialogue, specifically on that. We didn't ship units in Q4. But I guess I won't forecast the Q1 specifically for that just yet.Glenn MattsonOkay. Great. I'll jump in the queue and let someone else go.Eric BrockAlright. Thanks, Glen.OperatorMatthew Galinko, Maxim GroupMatthew GalinkoHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to maybe check in on the first responder opportunity in the US market. How is that developing? And how are any, I guess, changes to access to drones? How is that impacting first responder interest in the Optimus platform?Eric BrockYeah. Thank you, Matt. So there is quite a bit of interest in Optimus specifically. But of course, as we've shared on recent calls, and I know you're observing in the market, demand for DFR programs generally across the US is growing very rapidly. And we do expect to participate.We highlighted at the end of last year that we had a demonstration with a public safety customer, a major one. That was -- and then in the first quarter this year, we have performed a pilot program for that. It was a major pilot program, which was successful. And I guess I need to leave it at that. We're going to see from here how things progress with that customer on commercial orders and things like that.Matthew GalinkoGot it. All right. And just as my follow-up, I guess it wouldn't be conference call if we didn't ask about US's tariff posture and how that might influence your ability to deliver product and how it might affect costs. So just curious how you are positioned against some of the tariff issues and how nimble you can be to kind of offset some of that?Eric BrockWell, I don't see it having a major impact for us. We are not sourcing much, if anything, really from China directly. And so I think that's a simple answer, Matt. At the same time, I do say policy, I blow it up a little bit more. I think policy, particularly the Trump administration is proved to be extremely supportive for Western and US producers like us. So I do think that's going to be a nice tailwind for us really in the near term.Matthew GalinkoGreat. Thank you.OperatorMike Latimore, Northland Capital.Hey, hi, This is Aditya on behalf of Mike Latimore. Could you give some color on the gross margins for this year?Eric BrockYeah, sure. So we're expecting gross margins to recover this year, specifically driven by OAS and improved volumes. So if I'm looking at the first couple of quarters, you should probably look at them to be in the 40% range. And I think they can get to 50% or better as we're moving through the second half.And could you also give some color on how many drones you have in the inventory? And how much do you expect to manufacture this year?Eric BrockI don't want to share those details.All right. Got it. Thank you.Eric BrockThank you.OperatorCarter Mansbach, Forte Capital Group.Carter MansbachGood morning, gentlemen. Congrats on all that you've achieved and I look forward to '25. I need some clarity on Palantir. So it seems that you put out a press release yesterday with a partnership. You doubled and tripled down on that during this call. And it seems there's confusion as to the meaning of partnership.So clearly, Palantir gave you permission to put out that press release. It reads as if you're utilizing their product, not partnering with them. So please explain to me and I guess, shareholders why it's considered a partnership and how are they actually a partner? Thank you.Eric BrockSure. So first of all, as you're well aware, Palantir has vast capabilities and that range -- for build those capabilities range from enterprise resource planning systems. And of course, foundry AI is one of the key pieces or services they provide there. But that also includes tools around making autonomy more robust. And they have tools, data analytics, for example, that can be combined with the data we collect via our sensors that provide actionable intelligence.So in that sense, Palantir also serves as an integrator of capabilities where they can take complete advanced AI-enabled solutions directly to customers. So today, for us, the first step is really to integrate foundry AI, but I do believe longer term that we will see this evolve with Palantir AI being embedded in the product and solutions we develop on behalf of customers in terms of the technology road map. And this partnership does call for some elements of that, that we'll likely be able to share in the future.Carter MansbachOkay, great. Thanks guys. Best of luck.Eric BrockThank you.OperatorGlenn Mattson, Ladenburg Thalmann.Glenn MattsonYeah. Just on the network side, could someone just comment about the level of significance that the new administration is putting on whatever timelines that were previously in place? Obviously, it seems like I believe it was April 2026, there was a deadline to meet some sort of FCC requirements. Just what the status of that is, what the general thought is on how the administration is going to enforce that or extend that? Or just thoughts around that would be great. Thanks.Eric BrockYeah. Let me take a crack at it, and I'll see if Markus has anything to add. So firstly, we let the railroads speak to the deadlines. And as Markus highlighted, the AAR has publicly said they expect to meet the deadlines. And I'd highlight there's a couple of deadlines that matter.Firstly, there's September 2025, where they've agreed to retire the legacy network and that spectrum is being returned back to the FCC for -- to be reused elsewhere. And then there is also what is known as utilization requirements.So they're required to utilize the spectrum or in that instance, if they don't, the rules typically would require the spectrum to be the new spectrum, I'm talking about the greenfield, also known as the A-Block to be returned to the FCC.So that's simply it. I do believe that well, let me leave it at that. I don't want to speculate on what the administration or the FCC thinks about this. But Markus, would you add anything? I mean, perhaps you can share a bit more on the 220 and the 900 megahertz, the redundant network strategies and things like that as well as the other use cases in addition to CTC and PTC backup on that [900].Markus NottelmannYeah, certainly. Thanks, Eric. So really, the administration is new still, although it probably seems like it's been a long time already to some people, but still things are still shaking out at the FRA at the FCC. And I think, as Eric said, speaking for them in terms of what actions they will take and when they will enforce decisions, I think that's probably premature and the agencies have to speak for themselves.Now I do think the railroads are becoming more sophisticated in terms of how they look at their overall communication strategy. The idea of creating redundancy between the 220 and the sorry, the 220 and the 900 megahertz networks, I think that's a very real consideration for many of the Class Is. They do realize they have to upgrade their communications capabilities.They want to move away from single point of failure, and we're supporting them in those efforts. And as stated earlier in the presentation, again, those efforts are very real. We have a number of trials out on our pilot projects out on some of the Class Is. And as those programs close out, we expect to see network-wide rollout of those capabilities.Glenn MattsonOkay. Great, thanks for the color and I guess we'll see how the, look forward to further updates as the year progresses. Thank you.Eric BrockYep. Thanks, Glen.OperatorMatthew Galinko, Maxim Group.Matthew GalinkoHey, thanks. Can you maybe give us a refresher on the competitive environment for drone in the box, maybe domestically and international, more on the Optimus side?Eric BrockThe question was on the competitive environment?Matthew GalinkoYeah.Eric BrockSure. So I'll start by just discussing capabilities. And I think we would highlight that Optimus has unique capabilities around persistent availability and functionality with the persistent availability being particularly important for DFR applications where critical security is obviously critical. And that, of course, is enabled by our ability to swap batteries, right? So the dronal, your mission comes back, it's available immediately for the next mission.It's also critically important that the dock itself is industrial grade. And I think that's where we are able to work in very difficult conditions, particularly from a weather standpoint, either hot or cold environments, and that is a key differentiator.Otherwise, I think you'll see in the US, [Scadio obviously has a very competitive drone in the box capability. You'll see DJI as well with the design and capabilities of Scadio] system and DJI are fairly comparable. And I think that's the two that we see the most.Matthew GalinkoGot it. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, again, on the rail side, you brought up the scenario of, I guess, the railroad looking to eliminate single points of failure in their communications. Does that open up any avenue for competitors to 802.11 or dot16 to sort of work their way into the network now? Or do you still feel as confident as you were on our last update that you're sort of in a prime position?Eric BrockNo, we don't see any new competition to 802.16 for the private wireless networks.OperatorWas there a follow up Matthew?Matthew GalinkoNo, that was it. Thank you.Operator[Craig Scott, CSR Consulting]Craig ScottHey Eric, good call, nice call. Glad to see the progress being made. Could you just take us through a little bit of the cash position? And I know you have about $30 million on the books at the end of the year and what you foresee as a slowdown in cash burn or any possible need for more capital in 2025? Thank you.Eric BrockSure. So thank you, Craig. And we feel very good about our cash position for 2025. And of course, as we're moving through the year and seeing the revenue ramp we're going to realize some operating leverage that will bring the burn down progressively. So we would expect sequential growth in revenues for each quarter this year and for gross profit as well. So cash burn will be declining.Craig ScottOkay. Thank you. I'm good.Eric BrockThank you.OperatorThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Eric Brock for any closing remarks.Eric BrockWell, thank you. And as we wrap up, I do want to give you just a preview that we do expect to see an article run tomorrow in braking defense. This article is going to provide an update on our activity with Iron Drone and Optimus and share context on the progress we are making in military and homeland security markets. So please keep your eyes open for that.With that said, we appreciate you spending time with us today. I will reiterate that we expect a great year in 2025, and I do look forward to keeping you informed of our progress. So I hope you have a great day.

The chipmaker is currently viewed as undervalued compared to the broader industry, making it an attractive entry point. Based on the trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, NVIDIA is trading at 37.41, significantly lower than the industry average of 45.34.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWith unprecedented demand for its Blackwell AI chips, which are driving next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) models and inference systems across various industries, NVIDIA remains well-positioned for long-term growth. This favorable valuation, combined with its AI dominance, makes it an appealing investment at current levels.The company\u2019s AI computing revenues have doubled, largely driven by enterprise adoption and the increasing reliance of tech giants like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud on NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs. Beyond cloud computing, NVIDIA\u2019s AI technology is making significant strides in autonomous vehicles, robotics and healthcare, solidifying its position as a key player in multiple high-growth markets.Even amid market volatility and trade tensions, NVIDIA\u2019s strong AI and data center demand provide a buffer against economic downturns. While traditional tech stocks may be affected by geopolitical concerns, cloud providers and enterprises continue to expand their AI investments, ensuring NVIDIA\u2019s long-term revenue growth stays intact.

(PLTR): Jim Cramer on Meme Mania \u2013 \u2018What a Blast!", "content": "We recently published a list ofJim Cramer Looked At These 11 Stocks Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer looked at recently.On Wednesday, Jim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, shared his thoughts on the volatile trading day, pointing out that President Donald Trump\u2019s actions are reshaping how investors assess stocks. Cramer highlighted that before Trump came into the office, his method of evaluating a stock was looking at its price, earnings, revenues, and gross margins.\u201cNow, though, I start with a simple question: Can President Trump hurt the stock? Can he damage it with an offhanded comment? Can he crush it in anger? And most important, does the price-to-earnings multiple make sense in this new world in light of the president\u2019s love of tariffs and total hostility to the way this country\u2019s been running the past, not to mention many of our country\u2019s friends?\u201dREAD ALSO:10 Stocks on Jim Cramer\u2019s RadarandJim Cramer and Analysts Like These 10 StocksCramer specifically pointed to the automotive industry as a significant example of how Trump\u2019s approach to trade has shifted the dynamics of the market. He recalled how the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was originally created, partly to protect the U.S. auto industry from the influx of low-cost imports from countries like Japan and South Korea.\u201cWithout NAFTA, auto companies couldn\u2019t compete against the flood of imports from Japan and South Korea, which only have a 2.5% tariff on them. The tariffs President Trump slapped on American companies that import products from Mexico or Canada, 10 times that.\u201dCramer also acknowledged that the recent pause in tariffs for the auto industry caused a brief surge in market activity, which led to some unpredictability in stock movements. However, he noted that if automakers are forced to either pay the hefty tariffs or shift their production to the U.S., replacing inexpensive labor in Mexico with higher-cost union labor, their earnings could face a sharp decline. Cramer speculated that such a scenario could result in a significant cut in earnings, though he hoped the impact would not be as severe.\u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line: This market is fiercely trying to revalue stocks because of the president\u2019s comments. And we do it day after day after day because he\u2019s always making so much news. So it\u2019s been doing a poor job and that\u2019s created a ton of opportunities for you to both buy and sell and I say you take them right away.\u201dStory ContinuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money aired on March 5. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 1,000 hedge funds.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Its products, including Gotham, Foundry, Apollo, and the Artificial Intelligence Platform, help organizations manage and analyze large datasets. On March 5, William Blair upgraded the stock from Underperform to Market Perform, citing valuation after a 33% drop in shares from $125 to $84 in the last three weeks due to a \u201cDOGE-driven selloff.\u201dWhile the firm\u2019s valuation remains high, with risks of over 40% downside from potential delays in government contracts, the analyst noted some positive developments. Blair suggested that if the market shifts back to a risk-on mode, the stock could return to its previous peak. However, the firm expects the shares to remain range-bound over the next year, with continued volatility due to various factors, including the potential for a government shutdown on March 15, which could exert additional downward pressure.Overall, PLTRranks 7thon our list of stocks that Jim Cramer looked at recently. While we acknowledge the potential of PLTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Starmer had already set out plans last week toincrease the UK's spending on defenceto 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2027, up from its current level of 2.3%, with the target of reaching 3% in the next parliament.Read more:Top rated European stock alternatives to Nvidia and US Big TechLate on Monday, the White House then announced that the US would pause its military aid to Ukraine to support its continued fight against Russia's invasion. This heightened expectations that Europe could end up shouldering more of the responsibility for its own security.Meanwhile, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, unveiled the ReArm Europe plan on Tuesday, saying in an announcement that this could \"mobilise close to \u20ac800bn (\u00a3667bn) for a safe and resilient Europe\".Later on Tuesday, Trump appeared to soften his tone towards Zelensky in a speech in Congress, after receiving a letter from the Ukrainian leader. Trump quoted Zelensky as writing that Ukraine was \"ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer.\"While this eased geopolitical fears, a number of defence stocks were still rising on Wednesday morning. And even before these latest developments, investors were already anticipating more spending in defence, buying into stocks in the sector.Here's which defence stocks investors have been buying, as well as those that are highly-rated by analysts.Rolls-Royce Holdings (RR.L)FTSE 100 (^FTSE) aerospace and defence company Rolls-Royce Holdings (RR.L) was the fourth most bought stock on Interactive Investor's platform in February.Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said that the stock had been a mainstay of the platform's popular investments list for some time.Story ContinuesShares in Rolls-Royce (RR.L) soared last week after itreinstated its dividendand announced a \u00a31bn ($1.28bn) share buyback alongside its full-year results, with this week's sector-wide surge propelling the stock to fresh highs.Read more:Stocks that are trending todayIn the results, Rolls-Royce (RR.L) said underlying revenue had reached \u00a317.8bn in 2024, up from \u00a315.4bn in 2023. Underlying operating profit for the year rose to \u00a32.46bn from \u00a31.59bn in 2023.For 2025, the company guided to underlying operating profit of between \u00a32.7bn and \u00a32.9bn, and upgraded its mid-term target to between \u00a33.6bn and \u00a33.9bn.\"Nor does the group see that as the end game, describing the new targets as a milestone rather than a destination,\" said Hunter. \"This extraordinary corporate turnaround has resulted in a gain of 429% since the CEO [Tufan Erginbilgi\u00e7's] appointment two years ago. In the last year alone, the price has risen by 111%, and the market consensus of the shares as a 'buy' suggests that appetite remains undiminished.\"Bank of America (BAC) and Deutsche Bank (DBK.DE) have reiterated \"buy\" ratings on the stock over the past week.BAE Systems (BA.L)BAE Systems (BA.L) also reached a fresh high this week, hitting \u00a316.64 per share on on Monday.The stock entered Interactive Investor's most bought equities list for the first time in February, as well as featuring among AJ Bell's (AJB.L) most popular stocks with DIY investors last month.In its recent full-year results, BAE (BA.L) reported a 14% increase in sales in 2024 to \u00a328.3bn, as well as a 14% rise in underlying earnings before interest and tax to \u00a33.02bn.Stocks:Create your watchlist and portfolioIn addition, BAE (BA.L) reported a record backlog of orders of \u00a377.8bn, which was up 11% on the previous year.\"The group also projected further gains in adjusted profit this year of over 10%, while the previous \u00a34.4bn purchase of US company Ball Aerospace widened its product portfolio in the space sector,\" said Hunter.BAE (BA.L) raised its dividend 10% for the year to 33p per share, which Hunter pointed out marked its 18th consecutive year of payout increases.On the back of BAE's (BA.L) recent results, Deutsche Bank (DBK.DE) reiterated a \"buy\" rating on the stock. Analyst Christophe Menard said the results came in ahead of consensus on metrics including sales and earnings per share, while the company's guidance for the year was broadly in line with expectations.Rheinmetall (RHM.DE)German technology group Rheinmetall (RHM.DE), which supplies systems in the defence industry, is another name that was among AJ Bell's most popular stocks with DIY investors in February.The stock shot up to a record high share price of \u20ac1,199 on Monday and is up 82% year-to-date.Deutsche Bank reiterated a \"buy\" rating on the stock in a note on 24 February, with the stock having rallied on the back of the Munich Security Conference.Deutsche Bank analyst Christoph Laskawi said: \"With the shares moving up materially since then, a decent portion of additional defence spend across Europe is already priced in.\"However, we see further upside potential on momentum and the company providing more detailed analysis on which systems are most needed in Europe and what Rheinmetall (RHM.DE) can provide to support.\"QinetiQ (QQ.L)FTSE 250 (^FTMC) firm QinetiQ (QQ.L) was another popular stock for AJ Bell's DIY investors last month, with the latest rally in shares seeing the stock trade near record highs.QinetiQ (QQ.L) is a high-tech defence technology company, which was spun out of the UK's Ministry of Defence.In a third quarter trading update in January, QinetiQ (QQ.L) said it expected to continue to deliver high-single digit organic revenue growth for the full year and mid-term organic revenue of \u00a32.4bn, with a profit margin of around 12%, by 2027.Read more:Will bitcoin hit $125,000 this year? Have your sayOn the back of this update, Deutsche Bank (DBK.DE) reiterated its \"buy\" rating on the stock, while Barclays said its \"overweight\" rating on QinetiQ (QQ.L) remained unchanged.In a comment released last week, Matt Dorset, equity analyst at Quilter Cheviot, highlighted that 66% of QinetiQ\u2019s (QQ.L) sales are in the UK and that the business is \"closely connected to the research and services of the Ministry of Defence, having previously been state owned.\"\"This puts the business in a strong position to benefit from increased investment in defence spending,\" he said. \"QinetiQ (QQ.L) is exposed to faster growing areas of defence spending including research and development and testing and evaluation, which should be bolstered by additional spending commitments.\"Palantir Technologies (PLTR)While US data analytics software maker Palantir (PLTR) has seen a pullback recently,Barron'sreported on Monday that Wedbush Securities said this represented an \"opportunity\".Palantir (PLTR) shares slumped after the Trump administration announced plans toreduce defence spending, given the sector forms a key part of the company's business.However, Barron's reported that Wedbush analysts believed Palantir could weather planned defence budget cuts.Palantir (PLTR) was the fifth most bought stock on Interactive Investor's platform in February. The company's shares soared earlier last month, after itsfourth quarter earningscame in ahead of estimates. Revenue of $827.5m (\u00a3645.1m) beat expectations of $775.9m, while adjusted earnings per share of $0.14 was above estimates of $0.11.While the latest geopolitical developments have raised hopes for a peace deal for Ukraine, uncertainty still remains. Even before the events of recent days, politicians in Europe had signalled plans to increase defence spending, which investors expect to provide a boost to the sector.Read more:The underperforming 'dog' funds that have gobbled up more than \u00a367bnReeves to vow to cut red tape for defence deals as Ukraine pledge boosts stocksPound boosted by weakening dollar as 'Trumpcession' fears play outDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available forAppleandAndroid.", "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/defence-stocks-investors-europe-113147858.html", "published_date": "2025-03-05T11:31:48.000Z"}
{"article_id": "101500474", "title": "A New Vision From Defense Secretary Hegseth Could Be a Game Changer for Palantir Stock", "content": "It's been a weird year forPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)stock so far. Two months into 2025, Palantir shares gained nearly 7%. This handily outperforms theS&P 500andNasdaq Composite, which lost 2% and 6%, respectively. If you were to take that data at face value then you'd think Palantir is having a good year.However, there is more than meets the eye regarding these returns.During the month of February, Palantir stock had gained as much as 51%. But guess what? Shares only ended the month roughly 3% higher compared to January.Below, I'm going to dig into what influenced a near-30%sell-off in Palantir stockover the last couple of weeks. In addition, I'll explain why I think the ongoing sell-off is an opportunity to buy the dip in one of the highest-profile growth stocks leading the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.There are some major changes going on at the PentagonPalantir develops a suite of AI software platforms called Gotham, Apollo, and Foundry. The company sells its products to both the private and public sectors. However, as it stands today, more than 50% of Palantir's business comes from the government -- particularly, the U.S. military and other defense agencies.Recently, President Donald Trump made it clear that he wants to see changes at the Department of Defense -- in particular, he has his eyes on the Pentagon's budget. While the exact details are somewhat fluid, media reporting suggests that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has been ordered to find budget savings of 8% annually (or roughly $50 billion) over the next several years.Palantir investors were not pleased by this news, and hence, a pronounced sell-off took shape.Image source: Getty Images.Hegseth just dropped some interesting breadcrumbsBack in 2020, the DOD implemented a strategy called the Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP). According to publicly available documentation from the DOD, the purpose of the SWP is \"to provide for the efficient and effective acquisition, development, integration, and timely delivery of secure software.\"According to media outlet Breaking Defense, Hegseth has proposed doubling down on the SWP strategy as the Pentagon overhauls its budget.Palantir could be a major beneficiary of this initiativeOne of the nuances to point out regarding the Pentagon's budget changes is that the 8% savings aren't necessarily all going to be outright reductions. It's been reported that one of the goals of this initiative is to identify areas within the budget that are deemed non-essential to military operations and reallocate those dollars toward defense protocols. For this reason alone, I think the sell-off in Palantir stock is overly pronounced -- as there isn't any explicit evidence that the Pentagon is looking to part ways with the company.Story ContinuesMoreover, given Hegseth's SWP vision, I'm actually cautiously optimistic that Palantir could expand its relationship with the military during this budget overhaul process.One of the lesser-known product offerings at Palantir is a platform called FedStart.\u00a0FedStart is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) tool that helps companies achieve necessary accreditation standards required to deploy software within federal environments more efficiently. From there, companies can integrate their software with Palantir's Apollo platform and get up and running across the government.In my eyes, FedStart could be a major catalyst for the SWP process -- meaning that Palantir could be in a position to witness surging demand over the next several years as the DOD refines its budget. If anything, I think Palantir's existing relationship with the military could be deemed a valuable asset -- giving the company a launchpad to expand its infrastructure across the defense sector and accelerate growth.For these reasons, I think savvy investors may want to consider buying the dip in Palantir stock right now.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:TheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

{"article_id": "114500090", "title": "Tech Stocks Are Plummeting: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for Decades", "content": "Technology stocks witnessed a significant pullback of late, as evidenced by the 13% decline in theNasdaq-100 Technology Sectorindex in the past month. Investor sentiment soured due to the trade war sparked by the tariffs announced by the Trump administration on Canada, Mexico, and China, which led those nations to announce retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.The negative investor sentiment isn't surprising, as tariffs could increase the manufacturing costs for tech companies that rely on foreign markets to produce and assemble their goods.Artificial intelligence (AI)stocks, in particular, experienced steep sell-offs as investors rush to book profits in a risk-off environment.Shares ofPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR), for instance, are down 25% in the past month. Semiconductor bellwetherTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), popularly known as TSMC, lost 15% of its value over the same period. However, the recent pullback in these AI stocks looks like a buying opportunity for savvy investors, especially considering the strong results they deliver and the huge end-market opportunities they can benefit from.Let's look at the reasons why Palantir and TSMC could turn out to be solid long-term investments for investors looking to add AI stocks to their portfolios amid the ongoing sell-off in the technology sector.1. Palantir TechnologiesPalantir Technologies continues to trade at an expensive valuation despite the sharp drop in its stock price in the past month. However, the company is scratching the surface of a massive opportunity in the generative AI software space that could set it up for decades of healthy growth.McKinsey estimates that the AI software and services market could grow from $85 billion in 2022 to $1.5 trillion in 2040. The higher end of the management consulting firm's AI software and services revenue stands at a whopping $4.6 trillion in 2040. Palantir has already started benefiting from this huge addressable opportunity.Its customer base is growing rapidly, and the revenue pipeline is getting better with each passing quarter, leading to an acceleration in the company's revenue and earnings growth. For instance, Palantir's revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024 increased 36% year over year to $828 million. The company's earnings increased at a much faster pace of 75% thanks to higher spending by customers on its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP).Palantir's AIP helps both commercial and government customers embed generative AI tools into their operations, enabling them to improve productivity and efficiency. This explains why Palantir's customers tend to expand their usage of AIP after signing the initial deal. Even better, Palantir's customer count is swelling at an incredible pace, thanks to AIP. This was evident from management's comments on the Februaryearnings conference call, with Palantir Chief Revenue Officer Ryan Taylor pointing out, \"AIP continues to fuel new customer acquisition as we have nearly five times the number of U.S. commercial customers as we did three years ago and significant expansion opportunities at existing customers.\"Story ContinuesSo, it wasn't surprising to see Palantir closing $1.8 billion worth of contracts in the previous quarter, which was a terrific increase of 56% from the prior year. The company's contract book increased at a faster pace than its revenue, indicating that its growth could continue to pick up going forward. The remarkable growth in Palantir's contract value led to a 40% year-over-year jump in its remaining deal value to $5.43 billion. The metric refers to the total remaining value of contracts at the end of a quarter.All these metrics make it clear that Palantir is cornering a bigger chunk of the generative AI software market. Of course, the company may feel the impact of tariffs in the near term if its customers decide to tighten their purse strings on account of the trade war. However, the productivity gains delivered by integrating generative AI software solutions could eventually lead them to open their wallets in the future.That's why it would be a smart move to start accumulating Palantir stock while it is on its way down, as the immense potential of the generative AI software market could send the stock soaring over the long run.2. Taiwan Semiconductor ManufacturingTSMC is a key player in the global semiconductor industry. The Taiwan-based company fabricates chips for consumer electronics companies and major fabless chipmakers, and it is the biggest semiconductor foundry in the world, with a market share of 64%.This puts TSMC in a terrific position to capitalize on the secular growth of the semiconductor market in the long run. Deloitte estimates that the global semiconductor industry could more than triple in size over the next 15 years, generating $2 trillion in annual revenue in 2040. AI chips are going to play a central role in this market's massive growth in the long run, with their sales expected to increase at an annual rate of 35% over the next decade.TSMC fabricates chips for almost all the leading AI chip companies, ranging fromNvidiatoBroadcomtoAdvanced Micro DevicestoMarvell Technology. As a result, it is an indirect beneficiary of the hundreds of billions of dollars that are being poured by tech giants such asMicrosoft,Amazon,Meta Platforms, andAlphabetto shore up their AI infrastructure. TSMC also manufactures chips forAppleandQualcomm, which puts it on track to benefit from the AI-driven growth in the personal computer (PC) and smartphone markets.A big reason why TSMC is well ahead of its rivals in the foundry market is because the chips manufactured using its advanced process nodes enjoy a technological advantage. TSMC's customers are placing orders in bulk for its advanced chips, which is why the Taiwan-based company's factories that produce 3-nanometer (nm) and 5-nm chips are reportedly running at full capacity.The demand for these advanced chips is so strong that TSMC is on track to raise its capital expenditure by around 33% in 2025. The company plans to spend 70% of its 2025 capex on building advanced chip production facilities so that it can meet the strong demand from its AI customers. That's the right thing to do, as chips manufactured using advanced process nodes pack more computing power and consume less energy.This is the reason why chipmakers such as Marvell are already moving to the 2nm process node for manufacturing AI chips. Not surprisingly, analysts are forecasting TSMC's revenue from 2nm chips to grow by fourfold between 2025 and 2026. In all, TSMC is pulling the right strings to ensure that it remains the top semiconductor foundry in the world, and that should set the company up for years of outstanding growth.Management pointed out on the company's January earnings conference call that it expects its five-year revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 20%. It could sustain such growth for a much longer time, considering the secular growth opportunity in the semiconductor industry.And finally, the recent pullback in TSMC stock has brought its price-to-earnings ratio to just 25, a discount to theNasdaq-100index's earnings multiple of 30 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). Buying TSMC stock at this valuation looks like a no-brainer as the lucrative opportunity in semiconductors thanks to catalysts such as AI should ideally pave the way for decades of impressive growth at this company.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The stock rallied as much as 1,250% over the past two years before gravity took hold. Proposed spending cuts by the U.S. government and a high multiple weighed on Palantir stock, which is down roughly 30% (as of this writing) since its peak in mid-February.After a slump of those proportions, is it finally time to buy the stock?Has the tide turned?Palantir was riding high before some recent developments conspired to take the wind from its sails.In a regulatory filing, CEO Alex Karp revealed plans to sell 9,975,000 shares of stock using a so-called 10b5-1 trading plan, disposing of the shares between now and September. A great deal of Karp's compensation comes from stock options, so this isn't unusual, though the magnitude of the sale caught some investors off guard.Perhaps more concerning is the recent focus by the Trump administration to slash federal spending. According to initial reports, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth instructed Defense Department officials to slash existing budgets by about 8% annually over the coming five years. As a key supplier of data mining andartificial intelligence (AI)systems to the U.S. government, investors feared Palantir's growth could take a hit.In recent days, however, Republican lawmakers have proposed anincreasein military spending, bringing the total to nearly $1 trillion annually. This suggests funds from the proposed cuts will be reallocated, and statements by Hegseth support that view. He asserts these aren't cuts, but a \"refocusing and reinvesting existing funds\" into other initiatives.This suggests that news may not be as bad as originally feared. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes that \"Palantir's unique software approach will enable the company to gain MORE IT budget dollars at the Pentagon ... not less, despite these initial knee-jerk reactions from the Street.\"How's the valuation?While it still looks pricey in terms of traditional valuation metrics, the stock's forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio recently dipped below 1, the benchmark for an undervalued stock.

{"article_id": "101500251", "title": "A New Triumvirate Emerges in American Defense With Archer Aviation, Anduril, and Palantir Joining Forces", "content": "An unprecedented alliance is reshaping America's defense industry. This new triumvirate, consisting ofArcher Aviation(NYSE: ACHR), Anduril, andPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR), unites breakthrough innovations in three domains: advanced aerial mobility, autonomous defense systems, and data intelligence.Like the power-shifting triumvirates of ancient Rome, this modern coalition challenges established norms by integrating diverse technological capabilities into a formidable partnership. Together, they're positioned to disrupt traditional defense contractors while pioneering a security framework in which adaptability, innovation, and strategic vision drive national defense priorities.Image source: Getty Images.Here's what Archer Aviation investors need to know about this newly minted partnership.A strategic alliance of the highest caliberThe emergence of this powerful alliance couldn't come at a more opportune moment. On March 13, Archer and Palantir announced a partnership to build theartificial intelligence(AI) backbone for next-generation aviation technologies. This collaboration aims to develop software for critical aviation systems, including air traffic control, movement control, and route planning areas that have seen only incremental improvements for decades. If successful, this partnership ought to add exponential value to Archer Aviation over the next 10 years.But this is merely the latest development in a series of strategic moves. In December 2024, Archer formed an exclusive partnership with defense juggernaut Anduril to jointly develop hybrid electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for critical defense applications. Meanwhile, Anduril and Palantir recently announced their consortium to sell AI technology to the U.S. government.While all three companies bring unique strengths to this triumvirate, Archer Aviation stands to gain the most significant advantages for four clear-cut reasons:1. Unprecedented market disruption opportunityFor decades, commercial aviation has been dominated by a powerful duopoly consisting ofBoeingandAirbus, limiting innovation to incremental improvements. Archer's eVTOL technology represents the first true paradigm shift in aviation in generations.These next-generation aircraft are quiet, can operate in dense urban environments, and come with the added benefit of drastically lower emissions than traditional aircraft. Now, with Palantir's AI capabilities and Anduril's defense expertise, Archer is positioned to accelerate this disruption in a big way.Story Continues\"While the aviation industry has an unmatched level of safety, much of the legacy technology supporting the industry has only incrementally advanced,\" notes Adam Goldstein, Archer's founder and CEO, in a recent press release. \"AI and software present an inflection point that will shape the future of aviation.\"This vision aligns perfectly with Palantir's expertise in advanced data analytics, creating a synergy that could accelerate adoption of next-generation air mobility solutions.2. Dual market strategy with deep pocketsArcher is executing a two-pronged approach that many competitors cannot match:Civil aviation:The company's \"Launch Edition\" commercialization program is establishing a repeatable playbook to deploy its Midnight aircraft in dozens of early-adopter markets even before FAA-type certification. Abu Dhabi Aviation will reportedly be the first customer, with deployments beginning later this year.Defense sector:Through its exclusive partnership with Anduril, Archer is developing hybrid eVTOL aircraft for defense applications. As Goldstein noted in Archer's Q4 2024 earnings report, \"the potential demand for this aircraft is stronger than expected.\" Critically, these defense applications may not require FAA certification, potentially accelerating revenue generation.Backing this dual-market strategy is over $1 billion in liquidity, giving Archer a remarkable runway to execute while maintaining relatively flat spending.3. Pentagon's shifting priorities and political momentumThe latest shift in Pentagon spending priorities under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth creates a perfect storm of opportunity. Hegseth has directed the department to prioritize programs like the Collaborative Combat Aircraft, which includes drones from Anduril, and to focus on attack drones, autonomous systems, and drone defense technology, all areas where this triumvirate excels.The tech industry now has unprecedented access to Pentagon officials, with venture capitalists like Joe Lonsdale, Trae Stephens, and Peter Thiel all connected to companies in this triumvirate actively consulting with the administration on reshaping military priorities.As Jacqueline Tame, acting executive director of Silicon Valley Defense Group, observed in an interview withThe Wall Street Journal, \"I've been advising companies and venture firms to just jump on this train because we don't know how long it will last, but it is incredibly favorable to defense tech.\"This political momentum creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Archer and its partners to rapidly scale their defense business while traditional contractors struggle to adapt to shifting Pentagon priorities.4. Production scale-up amid widespread AI integrationArcher is now starting production of its first Midnight aircraft at its ARC facility in Covington, Georgia, with plans to build up to 10 aircraft this year. The partnership with Palantir will leverage Foundry and AIP to accelerate the scaling of Archer's manufacturing capabilities, potentially solving one of the biggest challenges facing eVTOL companies: moving from prototype to mass production.The AI integration goes beyond manufacturing. As Alex Karp, Palantir's co-founder and CEO, explained at the signing ceremony for this partnership:Palantir's partnership with Archer is redefining the future of flight, making it not only more efficient but also more accessible. By integrating Palantir's advanced AI capabilities with Archer's innovative approach to aircraft manufacturing and operations, we are setting the stage for a transformative leap in efficiency, safety, and sustainability.The broader implicationsThis triumvirate represents more than just business partnerships; it signals a fundamental shift in how defense technologies are developed and deployed. Traditional defense contractors have dominated the industry for decades, with complicated weapons systems taking years to develop. Now, this alliance offers a more agile, innovative approach that could finally break the old industrial defense structure.For investors and industry watchers, Archer represents the most direct play on this transformative trend, combining cutting-edge aviation technology with AI-powered systems and defense applications. As the company prepares to deliver its first revenue-generating Midnight aircraft later this year, it stands at the nexus of multiple powerful trends that could reshape not just defense contracting, but the very future of aviation itself.The aviation industry stands at an inflection point, and this new triumvirate with Archer at its center appears perfectly positioned to capitalize on this moment of unprecedented change. With a current market capitalization of just $3.93 billion, Archer stock represents a compelling investment opportunity, particularly considering its multiple commercial avenues and potential total addressable market reaching hundreds of billions of dollars by the mid-2030s.Of course, there are considerable risks in play, such as regulatory, development, or manufacturing setbacks. The novelty of this new form of aviation also brings its unique risks. But for risk-tolerant investors, Archer Aviation's core value proposition of revolutionary technology, strategic partnerships, and substantial liquidity makes it a compelling opportunity at its current valuation.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(PLTR) the Best Growth Stock Under $100 to Buy Now?", "content": "We recently published a list of10 Best Growth Stocks Under $100 to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other best growth stocks under $100 to buy now.Growth stocks are shares of companies which are expected to grow their revenue and earnings at a faster rate than the market average. These companies typically reinvest profits into expansion rather than paying dividends, aiming for long-term capital appreciation. Their high growth, however, tends to be priced at high valuations by the markets, making them significantly more expensive (in terms of P/E multiple, for example) than their more mature, value counterparts. As a result, the performance of growth stocks often depends on general market sentiment\u2014during economic expansions, these stocks tend to outperform as their high growth expectations translate into reality, and their valuation multiple tends to expand; conversely, upon the slightest headwind or macroeconomic uncertainty, their growth and valuation multiple plummet.READ ALSO:12 Best Growth Stocks Under $25 to Buy NowGrowth stocks had a strong period of relative outperformance during 2021, as the zero-interest-rate environment, coupled with government stimulus, facilitated unprecedented growth in many industries, especially the consumer-related ones. This strong expansion fueled inflation, and as a result, growth stocks were hit hard by interest rates rising to more than 5% in the US \u2013 2022 was a bad year for the US stock market and especially growth stocks. However, 2023 brought in a whole new growth story for the global markets \u2013 not only did the US economy adjust to the new regime of higher interest rates, but also the proliferation of AI megatrend created whole new giant markets and reinvestment opportunities across different sectors, ranging from software developers, semiconductor equipment manufacturers, automation players, and ending with water management, cooling and other infrastructure needed to support the future AI framework around the world.The aforementioned developments led to a particularly strong 2023-2024 for the broad market and especially for growth stocks. Market valuations, as well as stock market concentration, reached close to record highs, as investors\u2019 optimism in the \u201cRoaring 2020s\u201d scenario and the tremendous AI growth opportunities far outweighed potential recession fears and the negative impact of still elevated interest rates. The high valuation of the entire market, and particularly that of growth stocks, tends to coincide with the length of the horizon that the markets expect the economy to grow undisrupted with little to no risk. However, the new Trump 2.0 regime puts the previous growth scenario at risk\u2014the \u201cRoaring 2020s\u201d scenario, which assumed significant economic acceleration due to onshoring, government stimulus, and huge productivity gains from AI, is now threatened by big cuts in federal financing of many large projects, as well as by the newly established tariffs potentially fueling a second wave of inflation, which will, in turn, require even higher interest rates in the economy.Story ContinuesThe threats are confirmed by several forward-looking indicators and surveys, such as business conditions and CapEx outlook from the management of both large and small businesses, as well as by a new wave of layoffs going on in February. While the layoffs in the public sector were largely expected, February 2025 data also shows accelerating layoffs in the retail and technology sectors, which indirectly signals a weaker economy ahead. It is of no surprise that the broad US market sold off in the last few weeks, with many technology leaders down significantly from their 2024 peaks. We believe that attractive investment opportunities arise at times when fear and doubt take over the investors\u2019 sentiment and lead to cheaper valuations for many growth stocks that would eventually recover as the challenges are navigated.Our MethodologyWe define growth stocks as those that have the potential to deliver future growth significantly above the average company in the universe.

{"article_id": "141500797", "title": "Artificial Intelligence Juggernaut Palantir Is Down 32%. Is It Time to Buy the Dip in the Stock?", "content": "Is the party finally over for the shares ofPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)? It took just over two years for the stock to rise from the $6 per share range to the all-time closing high of $124.62 per share. Still, within less than a month, it has surrendered 32% of its value.Admittedly, most of the run-up occurred over the previous four months, which may add to the uncertainty about its price. Hence, the question for investors is whether the 32% decline is a natural pullback after a rapid increase, or is it just the beginning of a longer-term decline to come.Palantir's changing businessBefore Palantir launched itsIPOin 2020, its AI-driven analysis technology earned credit for helping U.S. intelligence agencies find Osama bin Laden. Also, noting the relatively limited client base on the government side of the business with its Gotham platform, the company created the Foundry platform to bring this technology to commercial customers.However, the platform that has become most game-changing for Palantir is its Artificial Intelligence Platform, better known as AIP. Organizations credited this generative AI platform with delivering massive productivity gains.In itsfourth-quarter 2024 earnings call, Palantir cited an insurance organization that applied AIP to automate underwriting workflows. It took what was a two-week process and completed the work in three hours. The company also told the story of a telecom company that used AIP to help decommission aging technology and equipment more rapidly.Effects on the company's numbersSuch stories likely helped fuel the aforementioned run-up in its stock price. Nonetheless, investors should question whether the company's financial performance justifies the massive increase.In 2024, revenue of almost $2.9 billion rose 29% compared to 2023. Moreover, revenue rising by 36% yearly in Q4 points to increasing growth rates. Plus, U.S. revenue grew 38% annually in 2024, which could bode especially well for Palantir since the U.S. accounted for about two-thirds of overall revenue.Additionally, net income in 2024 totaled $462 million, up by 120% year over year, which could arguably help it justify a higher valuation.Still, investors may feel increasingly uncomfortable about the stock's valuation. They may overlook the P/E ratio of around 450 since the company only turned profitable on a yearly basis in 2023. However, the forward P/E ratio of approximately 150 makes it likely the stock price is far ahead of company fundamentals. Investors may also struggle to justify a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of over 70, especially since that valuation comesafterthe 32% pullback.Story ContinuesFurthermore, growth is likely on track to slow, according to the company itself. In 2025, Palantir forecasts revenue of $3.75 billion at the midpoint, which would amount to a 32% increase from 2024 levels. Most investors would objectively perceive that as a rapid growth rate. Nonetheless, investors often punish stocks for slowing growth, which could hurt Palantir's shares in the near term.Is it time to buy the dip in Palantir stock?Given the productivity gains that companies have made using its AIP platform, Palantir's business should continue to grow rapidly for the foreseeable future.Still, the stock price has likely risen far ahead of its current and future growth, which could lead to lower (or possibly negative) returns for the stock's recent investors in the short and medium term.For now, investors should keep the stock on a watchlist. If valuations fall to more reasonable levels, it will may be worth considering, but at these levels, it is more likely to continue falling before fomenting a sustained recovery.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

{"article_id": "103000105", "title": "Are Analysts all Wrong About Palantir Technologies Stock?", "content": "Data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) companyPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)has been one of the hottest growth stocks to own over the past couple of years. Since 2023, it rose by around 1,200%, which dwarfs the 680% gains that chipmaker and AI giantNvidiahas amassed during that same stretch. Palantir joined theS&P 500, and it's now part of the even more exclusiveNasdaq-100index.But if you were to go off of analyst price targets, you'll see that the consensus target today is just $74.79. Palantir flew past that on its way to a high of more than $125 earlier this year. Are analysts just flat out wrong about the stock, and could Palantir still be a good buy after its recent dip in price?Palantir's price targets have been risingAlthough the consensus analyst price target may seem low, individual analysts have been bumping up their targets for the stock. Six of the 10 most recent price targets for Palantir have been above $100, seeming to imply that many analysts see the stock bouncing back from its recent fall in value; its trading for less than $85 at the time of this writing. Based on that, you might expect to see at least 17% upside for theAI stockright now. As analyst price targets go up, the consensus (which is an average) will also rise.Analysts routinely upgrade their price targets, usually after there is significant news, including an earnings announcement. And that's what happened in early February after Palantir posted its latest earnings numbers, which showed the company's growth rate accelerated yet again. Demand for its AI-powered platform remains robust, as sales for the last three months of 2024 totaled $827.5 million and rose by 36% year over year. In the previous quarter, its year-over-year growth rate was a more modest 30%.Why setting a price for the stock may be difficultPalantir isn't as risky as a meme stock, but there's no doubt that there's a lot of speculation, hype, and excitement pushing its valuation higher these days. Perhaps investors are expecting its growth rate to continue to soar as Palantir reaches new government and commercial customers. But even if you consider its strong growth prospects, it can still be difficult for analysts to find a way to set a reasonable price target for the stock given how significant of a premium investors are paying for it right now.Currently, the stock is trading at around 436 times its trailing profits. To put that into context of how expensive that is, here's a look at other tech companies which trade at 100 times their trailing profits. I've filtered this chart to include only stocks which have market caps in excess of $100 billion.Story ContinuesPLTR PE Ratiodata byYCharts.Given how much euphoria seems to be around Palantir, it's incredibly difficult for analysts and investors who rely on any kinds of valuation metrics and multiples to determine where Palantir's stock may go. But one thing is for sure: This is an extremely expensive stock to own.Palantir is soaring today, but that could quickly changeShares of Palantir have fallen by more than 33% in less than two weeks' time. News of tech giantMicrosoftcancelling some AI data center leases may have spooked AI investors. That underscores the danger with Palantir's stock because as quickly as it has rallied, it could give back its gains just as fast.I think analyst price targets are wrong about Palantir, but that's because they still look far too bullish given the results the company has achieved thus far. The stock's recent fall in price shows how volatile it can be since speculation plays such a significant part of its valuation. Unless you have an extremely high risk tolerance, you're likely better off avoiding the stock even with its recent dip in value.

{"article_id": "120134088", "title": "Analysts revisit Palantir stock ratings amid $90 billion slump", "content": "Updated at 10:12 AM ESTPalantir Technologies shares moved higher in early Wednesday trading, but have fallen sharply over the past month, as analysts look to the impact of insider selling from top executives and planned government spending cuts on the data analytics group.Palantir(PLTR)shares, a standout market performer that has gained more than 910% over the past two years, have levelled-off notably since peaking in mid-February amid concerns tied to pullback in government spending and emergence of China's cut-priced DeepSeek AI chatbot.Company executives, including CEO Alex Karp, are also looking to cash in on the stock's meteoric rise, noted in the group's recent annual report as well as\u00a010b5-1 plan filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Karp, in fact, is planning to offload another $45 million in Palantir shares his year, having sold around 21% of his stake over the past six months.Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, who maintained his 'underperform' rating on Palantir stock in a note published Wednesday, said the recent share sales aren't his only concerns.Palantir shares have lost more than $90 billion in value since their Feb. 18 peak.SOPA Images/Getty Images\"After peaking at 61x (2026) revenue, Palantir's multiple has quickly compressed by 36% to 39x but is still around two times higher than the next-highest software name,\" Thill said. \"Given how other big multiple stories have traded post-peak, we think there is more multiple contraction to come.\"DOGE cuts in focusInvestors have also been spooked by comments from\u00a0Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth, who has vowed to take around 8%, or $290 billion, out of the Pentagon budget over the next five years, a move that could affect one of Palantir's crucial revenue sources.The U.S.\u00a0Department of Defense for around 17% of Palantir's overall revenue in 2024, and around 18% in 2023, according to its annual report.Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, however, feels Palantir could actually gain from the DOGE-lead focus on government cost-cutting given its \"unique software value proposition.\"Related: Palantir stock hit hard as worry mountsPalantir uses its artificial-intelligence platform, known as AIP, to help clients pull together disparate collections of data into a single model that they then can build, train and deploy in their day-to-day processes.The group also benefits from its ontology offering, a framework that helps represent and connect real-world entities, data and processes for its government and commercial clients.Palantir may boost government efficiency\"Palantir is in the sweet spot to benefit from a tidal wave of federal spending on AI while other non-strategic areas of the federal IT budget get scrutinzied/cut,\" Ives said in a note published earlier this week.Story Continues\"The company has received FedRAMP high [the highest level of security in the government's authorization management program] for its entire cloud services, allowing it sell products across the entire US government including, the most sensitive workloads in its cloud offerings,\" Ives said.\"We also believe Palantir is attached to many programs/contracts in the DoD that are safe and not at risk of getting cut in this new spending climate given their high priority,\" he added.Related: Analyst revisits Palantir stock forecast following annual report filingWilliam Blair analyst\u00a0Louie DiPalma also struck a more upbeat tone, and lifted his rating on the stock to 'outperform' in a note published Wednesday, but warned that a government shutdown on March 15 could trigger \"further downside pressure.\"\"While valuation is still frothy with potential downside risk of greater than 40% on government contract delays, there have been positive developments,' DiPalma said.\"If the market reverts to risk-on mode, the stock price may return to its prior peak, but we expect shares to be range-bound over the next year with continued elevated volatility given the puts and takes,\" he added.Bullish outlookPalantir posted stronger-than-expected fourth quarter earnings of 14 cents per shares earlier this month,\u00a0with revenues rising 36% from the year-earlier period to $827.5 million, thanks in part to a surge in demand for AI-related products offered by its commercial business.Palantir forecast 2025 revenue in the region of $3.75 billion, firmly ahead of the LSEG estimate.

{"article_id": "210200416", "title": "Palantir Jumped Today. Is the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock a Buy?", "content": "Palantir(NASDAQ: PLTR)stock rose nearly 7% in Wednesday's trading.The artificial intelligence (AI) software leader's share price was climbing following news that new 25% tariffs on automobiles imported from Mexico and Canada will be delayed a month. The tariffs could cause major pricing increases on vehicles in the U.S., and were viewed by some economists and industry experts as potentially having a destabilizing impact on the auto market.While the auto news doesn't impact Palantir directly, it was having an impact on valuations across the broader market as investors are showing signs of relief that one of the most potentially impactful developments from new tariff policies is being pushed further out and may get resolved before going into effect.In addition to developments on the tariff front, Palantir stock also seems to have gotten a lift from analyst coverage. William Blair published coverage on the company and upgraded its rating on the stock from underperform to market perform. The firm's analysts said they still think Palantir's heavily forward-looking valuation creates big downside risk, but they believe that shares are more reasonably valued on the heels of sell-offs that have taken place over the last month.Is Palantir stock a buy right now?Following an impressive rally last year, Palantir stock has been highly volatile in 2025. While the company's share price is still up 18% across this year's trading, it's also down 28.5% from its high mark even after today's gains.In addition to macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility, Palantir stock has seen some downward pressures as investors struggle with how to value the business and assess its long-term opportunity. Despite some big sell-offs over the last month, Palantir is still valued at approximately 160 times this year's expected earnings and 55 times expected sales.Palantir has an extremely growth-dependent valuation -- and one that sets the stage for significant downside risk if business performance comes in below expectations or macro conditions worsen significantly. On the other hand, the company has a clear leadership position in areas of the AI software market that are poised for massive long-term growth. For long-term investors, I think that taking a buy-and-hold approach to Palantir stock at today's prices will be a winning move despite volatility.Should you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?Before you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:TheMotley Fool Stock Advisoranalyst team just identified what they believe are the10 best stocksfor investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

Over the weekend, President Trump fielded questions regarding recession worries on FOX News, calling the market struggle \"a period of transition,\" but that didn't do much to calm investors. The sell-off was particularly pronounced in the tech sector, with the Nasdaq falling 3% into correction territory, while the S&P 500 also posted a 2% decline.The shares closed the day at $76.38, down 10% from previous close.The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.

But moves this big are rare even for Palantir and indicate this news significantly impacted the market\u2019s perception of the business.The previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago when the stock gained 5.6% on the news that Wedbush analysts reaffirmed their Buy rating, suggesting they were unshaken in their resolve, after the company appeared to have surrendered most of its post-earnings (Q4 2024) stock gains amid worries about government budget cuts. The analysts highlighted Palantir's ability to win a bigger share of the remaining pie, citing its AI capabilities and involvement in key military projects.Palantir is up 1.4% since the beginning of the year, but at $76.25 per share, it is still trading 38.8% below its 52-week high of $124.62 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Palantir\u2019s shares at the IPO in September 2020 would now be looking at an investment worth $8,026.Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

{"article_id": "091500510", "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy in the Tech Sell-Off", "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks were the market superstars over the past two years,\u00a0leading theS&P 500and theNasdaqto double-digit gains. And for good reason. The technology could be the next big thing for companies, helping them streamline their operations and pump up earnings. AI has already helped some players do just that, demonstrating that it could become a game-changer for many.But in recent days, these stars haven't been glowing as brightly as before. Concerns about the general economic environment have weighed on them amid new government policies and President Donald Trump's implementation oftariffson the U.S.'s largest trading partners, Canada, Mexico, and China.These tariffs are a concern because they could lift prices for certain companies that manufacture outside the U.S. and spark rising inflation within the country. This could directly increase these companies' costs, and higher inflation might hurt customers' wallets, resulting in lower revenue.So, the tech-heavy Nasdaq has dropped more than 7% over the past two weeks, led by AI stocks. But it's important to remember that today's headwinds aren't permanent and don't change the long-term growth stories of many of these AI players. That's why now isn't the time to sell but instead to buy. Let's check out two AI stocks to pick up in the tech sell-off.Image source: Getty Images.1. AmazonAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN)has benefited from AI across its two high-growth businesses:e-commerceand cloud computing. The company uses AI in e-commerce to gain efficiency and please customers and sellers on its platform. For example, AI helps Amazon define the fastest and shortest delivery routes for packages, saving the company time and money. And fast delivery is something customers like, a point that may encourage them to keep ordering from Amazon.Amazon has already scored a major win in AI through its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). As of the fourth quarter of last year, AWS has generated a $115 billion annual revenue run rate.AWS drives Amazon's overall profit, selling customers a wide variety of AI products and services -- fromNvidia's premium chips and lower-cost Amazon-made chips to a fully managed service that allows customers to tailor popular large language models to their needs. And since AWS is the world's biggest cloud provider, it already has an audience right there, ready to sign up for its latest AI offerings.I also like Amazon for its long record of earnings growth, and the company's move in recent years to revamp its cost structure should continue boosting revenue in the coming quarters. Amazon shares have slipped more than 10% over the past month, leaving them trading for about 32 times forward earnings estimates, down from more than 45 times late last year.\u00a0Considering my points above, the stock looks like a bargain buy and hold at today's level.Story Continues2. Palantir TechnologiesIn recent days,Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)faced an additional headwind to those mentioned above. The company, which sells AI-driven software to government and commercial customers, saw its shares slip after the Pentagon -- a major customer -- proposed cutting spending by 8% every year over the coming five years.But I think the concerns surrounding this news were overdone. It's important to remember that the Trump administration is focusing on gaining efficiency across departments, and Palantir's AI software helps customers do exactly that. The software aggregates a customer's data and makes better use of it. For example, it streamlines operations and reduces costs. So, the government's focus on efficiency could potentially lead to more contracts for Palantir.Meanwhile, Palantir's commercial business has taken off in recent quarters, delivering double-digit revenue growth and increasing contract value. In the latest period,\u00a0Palantir closed more than $800 million in U.S. commercial contract value -- a record level -- for a 134% increase year over year. So, the commercial customer could represent a major growth driver for the company in the years to come.Thanks to the commercial customer trends and ongoing double-digit growth in the government business, Palantir's earnings have soared,\u00a0the company was invited to join the S&P 500 last year, and the stock has advanced more than 700% over the past three years. But that also resulted in a sky-high valuation. The good news is that the stock's 27% decline over two weeks has brought its valuation down. Today, the forward price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) has fallen below 1, suggesting the stock is no longer overvalued. So, now is a fantastic moment for growth investors looking for a top AI player to scoop up some shares.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

{"article_id": "152746196", "title": "Is Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) the Best Meme Stock To Buy Right Now?", "content": "We recently published a list of13 Best Meme Stocks To Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other best meme stocks to buy right now.What are Meme Stocks?Meme stocks are largely driven by social media hype. These stocks gain popularity through memes, modified images, videos, and text shared online, often with positive sentiment by individual investors. Joey Loss, founder of Flow Financial in Jacksonville, Florida, commented in June 2024:\u201cMeme stocks appeal to our fear of missing out (FOMO) and our desire to get rich quickly. For many investors, it may also appeal to our desire to belong to the tribe\u2013as forums across the internet and social media will create the perception that everyone is participating.\u201dMeme stocks emerged as a trend in late 2020 and early 2021 when online communities started promoting certain companies\u2019 shares and generating buzz to attract buyers. The rise of commission-free trading platforms and online investing groups during the COVID-19 pandemic played a major role, as many people were at home with extra funds from government aid. Low interest rates may have also encouraged new investors. Meme stock investing was particularly appealing to younger investors who preferred it over traditional investment strategies.Meme Stock PerformanceIn 2024, meme stocks remained popular across industries, propelled into fame by social media and the appeal of quick profits. Platforms like Reddit\u2019s WallStreetBets played a notable role in fueling speculation, as investors sought higher returns than traditional assets. Despite skepticism from major financial institutions, the excitement around these stocks persisted. Political figures have also influenced market trends. For example, a media company associated with President Trump saw its stock rise to $70 in early 2024 before dropping to $13 by September, all because of the election frenzy. While the stock later rebounded to $36, the company continued to face challenges, reporting a $19.2 million loss in the third quarter of 2024.Similarly, a well-known video game retailer that gained attention due to social media-driven hype remained a target for short sellers, even years after its dramatic short squeeze in early 2021. Over the last few years, this company has been a focus for investors betting against its stock. Initially, many short sellers expected the business to face bankruptcy, but as its valuation soared during the meme stock frenzy, they argued its market price no longer reflected its actual financial standing. Before its most significant short squeeze in January 2021, short interest exceeded 140%, meaning more shares were being shorted than were available in the market. While short interest dropped after that period, it remained high, as institutional investors became more cautious about taking large positions against the company.Story ContinuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we compiled a list of meme stocks based on the consensus of reputable websites, along with insights from Reddit to assess retail investor interest. Using Insider Monkey\u2019s Q4 2024 hedge fund database, we examined the hedge fund sentiment for each stock and selected 13 most popular ones. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the number of hedge fund holders as of Q4 2024.Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

In addition to research and development (R&D) for battery technology, Archer also faces challenges from a manufacturing perspective as well as a stringent regulatory environment, given high safety standards in the aviation field.Archer is using Palantir's Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) suites to help identify opportunities for efficiency in the manufacturing process, as well as building a new software platform to help in areas such as air traffic control and route planning.Image source: Getty Images.Why is this deal beneficial for Archer?I see the relationship between Archer and Palantir as mutually beneficial.The aviation industry has long been ruled by the likes ofBoeingandAirbus. While each of these companies made their mark in commercial aviation, it's fair to say that there has been little in the way of innovation in the industry for some time. Archer has an opportunity to write a new script in the aviation field -- paving the way for a more tech-first vision, underscored by breakthroughs in AI.In addition, a more subtle opportunity for both companies could be to leveragePalantir's relationship with the U.S. military. Archer has expressed explicit interest in selling its aircraft beyond commercial applications -- and the U.S. military has already taken note of how eVTOLs could be seen as advantageous in specific circumstances.Is the deal between Archer and Palantir a game changer?While Archer remains somewhat of a speculative investment opportunity right now, I am encouraged by the company's choice to work with top providers in the AI landscape. Given the successful launch of AIP over the last couple of years, I am optimistic that air mobility represents a compelling use case for Palantir's services.Story ContinuesFor Palantir, a successful deployment of its products with Archer could lead to further use cases down the road in the aviation industry more broadly. If the work with Archer proves successful, Palantir has an opportunity to parlay this case study as a template for more business with other companies disrupting the air mobility market.For these reasons, I see the deal between Archer and Palantir as potentially changing the game for both companies. I would caution investors from buying into a hype narrative right off the bat, though.Shares in Archer and Palantir have run up quite a bit over the last year, and this partnership alone does not warrant buying either stock today. Rather, I think investors are best off tuning into earnings calls or keeping a close eye on further press releases that may reference or update how Archer's use of Palantir is bearing fruit.Furthermore, my suspicion is that the deal with Archer is one of Palantir's smaller contracts. Given Archer is still a pre-revenue business, I suspect the company is highly cognizant of its expense profile. To me, working with Archer and witnessing a successful outcome will help Palantir from a brand perspective more than a financial one in the short term.Palantir has a unique opportunity to work with Archer across both the private and public sectors, and leverage this deal into future business with other leaders in the aviation space -- hence, potentially turning this deal into numerous opportunities down the road.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

{"article_id": "115549890", "title": "Is Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR) the Most Active US Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?", "content": "We recently published a list of10 Most Active US Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Palantir Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:PLTR) stands against other most active US stocks to buy according to hedge funds.Over the past five years, the U.S. stock market has experienced growth in trading volume. According to data from the World Bank, the total value of stocks traded in the U.S. increased from approximately $36.3 trillion in 2019 to over $44.3 trillion in 2022. The upward trend reflects the U.S. stock market\u2019s growth over the years. As of March 11, 2025, the total consolidated volume reached 19.3 billion shares, with major exchanges like NYSE and NASDAQ contributing significantly to this activity.Correlation Between Trading Volume and Stock ReturnsEmpirical studies have explored the relationship between trading volume and stock returns. For example, research on the BRVM found a directly proportional relationship between stock returns and trading volume. This means that when a stock sees an increase in volume, it might also experience a corresponding change in its return profile. The practical takeaway is that active stocks often benefit from greater investor interest, which can, in turn, drive short-term price momentum.While trading volume remains strong, the broader U.S. stock market is currently facing heightened volatility and economic uncertainty. The broader market index has dropped nearly 9% over the past month, reversing its gains from late 2024. This decline is largely driven by trade tensions and policy shifts, with new tariffs imposed on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada adding to investor concerns.The uncertainty surrounding these trade policies has led to increased caution among investors and a shift in investment strategies. Major indices, including NYSE and NASDAQ, have shown instability, while the Magnificent Seven tech stocks have collectively fallen by 14% in the last three weeks. Financial institutions have adjusted their forecasts in light of these developments. Goldman Sachs, for instance, has reduced its year-end target for the broader market from 6,500 to 6,200, citing elevated policy uncertainty and tighter financial conditions.While the market may face challenges, hedge funds continue to target stocks that remain highly active and resilient in volatile conditions. They often focus on highly active stocks due to their liquidity, volatility, and potential for short-term gains. Active stocks, characterized by high trading volume, provide hedge funds with the flexibility to enter and exit positions efficiently without significantly impacting prices. This makes them ideal for strategies such as momentum trading, arbitrage, and algorithmic trading. For instance, data from a leading electronic platform for the trading of bonds indicated that hedge funds\u2019 share of trading volumes in the European government bond (EGB) secondary market surged from 26% in 2018 to 56% in 2023. This substantial increase underscores hedge funds\u2019 preference for markets where high trading volumes allow for swift entry and exit positions. \u200bStory ContinuesOur MethodologyTo identify the 10 most active US stocks to buy according to hedge funds, we used the Finviz stock screener to filter stocks with an average trading volume above 2 million shares. These stocks were then sorted by volume to highlight the most actively traded ones. Next, we ranked them based on Q4 2024 hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey, analyzing recent 13F filings to determine which stocks had the highest institutional interest. The stocks below are ranked according to the number of hedge fund holders.At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).Is Palantir Technologies Inc.

That helped the auto sector in particular, and there was perhaps some hope that the door was open to more broadly delaying tariffs. The sentiment seemed to be shifting in the other direction today, and the market is in 'risk-off' mode, with sectors such as tech seeing outsized declines. As of this writing, the S&P 500 had fallen 7% from where it closed on February 19th and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 10% over the same period.The shares closed the day at $80.42, down 10.8% from previous close.The stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Palantir?Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.What The Market Is Telling UsPalantir\u2019s shares are extremely volatile and have had 32 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 5.6% on the news that Wedbush analysts reaffirmed their Buy rating, suggesting they were unshaken in their resolve, after the company appeared to have surrendered most of its post-earnings (Q4 2024) stock gains amid worries about government budget cuts. The analysts highlighted Palantir's ability to win a bigger share of the remaining pie, citing its AI capabilities and involvement in key military projects.Palantir is up 8.1% since the beginning of the year, but at $81.31 per share, it is still trading 34.8% below its 52-week high of $124.62 from February 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Palantir\u2019s shares at the IPO in September 2020 would now be looking at an investment worth $8,559.Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business.

{"article_id": "233900725", "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Palantir", "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)andPalantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)delivered terrific gains last year as shares of both companies shot up remarkably thanks to the fast-growing demand for their artificial intelligence (AI)-focused hardware and software solutions. But 2025 is turning out to be different for these red-hot growth stocks.While Nvidia stock has retreated nearly 14% in 2025, Palantir has lost a lot of ground in recent days after a solid start to the year. However, it cannot be denied that both companies are on track to benefit from lucrative end markets. While Nvidia's recent results suggest that the fast-growing demand for AI hardware continues to be a key growth driver for the company, Palantir continues to witness an improvement in its growth profile thanks to the expanding need forgenerative AIsoftware.However, if you had to buy one of these two AI stocks right now, which one should you be putting your money on? Let's find out.The case for NvidiaThe market has been doubting Nvidia's ability to sustain its healthy growth thanks to a variety of reasons ranging from export controls on its AI graphics processing units (GPUs) to a potential slowdown in AI infrastructure spending to threats from other types of chipssuch as custom processorsthat are being adopted by tech giants in a bid to lower their AI expenses.However, the company's latest quarterly results make it clear that the demand for its AI chips remains healthy. Nvidia's revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 (which ended on Jan. 26) increased a terrific 78% year over year to a record $39.3 billion. Adjusted earnings also increased by an impressive 71% to $0.89 per share. Both numbers were ahead of Wall Street's expectations.The guidance indicates that Nvidia is on track to sustain its healthy momentum. It is expecting $43 billion in revenue in the current quarter, which would translate to a 65% increase from the prior-year period. However, Nvidia could exceed its own expectations as it ramps up the supply of its latest generation Blackwell processors to support the fast-growing customer demand.More importantly, Blackwell can help Nvidia maintain its dominant position in the AI chip market thanks to its versatility. Management pointed out on the latest earnings conference call that \"Blackwell addresses the entire AI market from pretraining, post-training to inference across cloud, to on-premise, to enterprise.\"Nvidia further points out that the arrival of low-cost reasoning models such as DeepSeek's R1 is likely to increase computing demand substantially. This bodes well for the company's Blackwell architecture, which Nvidia claims is capable of processing requests 25 times faster at a 20 times lower cost when compared to the previous generation H100 processor. As such, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia maintaining its dominant share of around 85% in the AI chip market going forward.Story ContinuesThis is also probably the reason why analysts have increased their revenue growth expectations for the company for the current and the next two fiscal years.NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Yeardata byYChartsThe company's earnings, meanwhile, are expected to increase by 50% in the current fiscal year despite the near-term margin pressure it is going to face while ramping up the output of its Blackwell processors. Nvidia points out that its adjusted gross margin will head back to the mid-70% range later in the fiscal year from the low-70% range right now once Blackwell production is fully ramped up.So, don't be surprised to see Nvidia's earnings growing at a faster pace and exceeding analysts' expectations as the year progresses.The case for Palantir TechnologiesPalantir Technologies is one of the leading vendors of AI software platforms, a market that's expected to become massive in the long run. Market research firm IDC estimates that the global AI software platforms market could grow from $28 billion in 2023 to $153 billion in 2028 at an annual rate of more than 40%.This fast-growing market is already having a positive impact on Palantir's performance. The company's revenue growth accelerated to 29% in 2024 from a 17% increase witnessed in 2023. Given that Palantir's top line came in at just under $2.9 billion last year, it is easy to see that the company still has a lot of room for growth in the future considering the potential size of the AI software platforms market.What's worth noting here is that the pace at which Palantir is now signing new contracts is equaling the pace at which the AI software platforms market is expected to grow, as per IDC. The company reported a 40% year-over-year increase in its remaining deal value (RDV) in the fourth quarter of 2024 to $5.4 billion.That was a significant improvement over the 22% year-over-year increase in this metric in the third quarter. Palantir's RDV refers to the total value of the company's unfulfilled contracts at the end of a quarter. So, the faster growth in this metric is proof that the company is now signing contracts at a faster pace than it is fulfilling, paving the way for stronger revenue and earnings growth in the future.There is a good chance that Palantir's revenue pipeline will continue to improve in the future as the new customers that the company brings on board tend to sign bigger contracts eventually, thanks to the efficiency gains delivered by its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Palantir's overall customer count was up by 43% year over year in the previous quarter. As these customers start deploying Palantir's AIP into more areas, the company should witness an improvement in its RDV.Also, the higher spending by existing customers is contributing toward an improvement in Palantir's margins. Its adjusted operating margin increased by 11 percentage points year over year last quarter. Not surprisingly, Palantir's adjusted earnings shot up an impressive 64% in 2024 to $0.41 per share. Analysts are expecting Palantir to sustain strong double-digit earnings growth going forward, though don't be surprised to see it exceed those expectations thanks to its fast-improving revenue pipeline and margin improvements.PLTR EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Yeardata byYChartsThe verdictWhile Nvidia allows investors to benefit from the lucrative AI hardware market, Palantir enables them to make the most of the rapidly improving adoption of generative AI software. So, both companies could find a place in a diversified portfolio. However, the problem with Palantir is that it trades at a huge premium when compared to Nvidia, a company that's growing at a faster pace.NVDA PE Ratiodata byYChartsPalantir's expensive valuation has created concerns that the stock may have gotten ahead of itself and is one of the reasons why it has pulled back significantly of late. Not surprisingly, analysts are expecting Palantir to deliver just 15% gains in the next year as per its median price target of $97. Nvidia, on the other hand, is expected to jump 51% over the next 12 months, according to analysts.That won't be surprising as Nvidia's cheaper valuation and the faster earnings growth that it is expected to deliver this year could lead the market to reward it with more upside as compared to Palantir, making it easier for investors to decide which one of these two AI stocks is a better buy right now.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

{"article_id": "080500498", "title": "Palantir Stock Is Down 37% From Its Peak: Here's What Could Happen Next", "content": "At the time of writing,Palantir's(NASDAQ: PLTR)stock price is down 37% from an all-time high of roughly $125 reached on Feb. 18. This is an alarming turn of events for a Wall Street darling that has benefited from two big hype cycles: generative AI and the election of Donald Trump.Let's dig deeper to find out if this dip is a buying opportunity or a signal to stay far away from an increasingly volatile tech stock.What has changed for Palantir?Since hitting public markets through an initial public offering (IPO) in October 2020, Palantir has always enjoyed a bit of a cult following. For years, the CIA-funded start-up made a name for itself by helping government and military clients with big data analytics -- playing a crucial role in the War on Terror when the company helped the U.S. track down Osama Bin Laden in 2011.But even at the start of its public trading, Palantir was more hype than substance. After the IPO boom, shares languished for around four years until the generative artificial intelligence (AI) hype cycle reignited interest in the company. The expectation is that generative AI will allow Palantir to improve its data analytics capabilities -- even offering real-time insights during fast-paced scenarios like battlefields or law enforcement operations.The synergy is undeniable.Large language models (LLMs)need large amounts of data, which Palantir already handles for its clients. General AI will be yet another tool in its tool kit as it helps organizations optimize their operations, detect fraud, and accomplish critical missions.A story of hype over fundamentalsWhile Palantir has clear synergies with generative AI, that isn't actually translating to booming growth. In full-year 2020 (two years before ChatGPT introduced the world to generative AI), Palantir's revenue grew by 47%. However, by the full year 2024, the growth rate fell to 29%, which indicates that the new tech isn't exactly a game changer.For comparison, an AI winner likeNvidiasaw its top-line growth increase from 53% to 114% over the same time frame.Despite not being a major AI winner, Palantir's stock price climbed a whopping 722% over the last five years, slightly outpacing Nvidia's 704%. This dynamic shows how much hype is built into Palantir's valuation.PLTR data by YChartsPalantir's bottom-line situation is also disappointing. While the company reports adjustedearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization(EBITDA) of $379.5 million, this adds back a whopping $281.8 in stock-based compensation, which is company equity given to employees. While this allows Palantir to save cash, it can increase the number of shares outstanding and dilute the holdings of existing shareholders.Story ContinuesDoes Palantir have a Trump card?Trump's election victory has been another source of hype for Palantir (shares rose more than 60% since Nov. 5.). But just like with AI, this presents few fundamental advantages for the company. Trump has been working to reduce U.S. federal spending. Under new Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the Pentagon plans to slash its budget by 8% (around $50 billion annually) every year for the next five years.U.S. government clients made up around 42% of Palantir's revenue in 2024. With Uncle Sam set to tighten his belt over the coming years, Palantir could be in hot water.Further challenges come from overseas government clients like the armed forces of Ukraine, which uses Palantir's software for targeting in its war with Russia. Trump is working to wind down this conflict, potentially cutting more of the company's vital revenue stream.Image source: Getty Images.Palantir stock is a screaming sellWith aforward price-to-earnings (P/E)multiple of 135, Palantir's stock price doesn't account for the company's many challenges. Top-line growth is decent but not spectacular, while extreme stock-based compensation expense eats into its bottom line. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is shaping up to be a challenge, not an opportunity.Palantir shares have already fallen 37% from their all-time high, and unfortunately, even more downside looks inevitable.Don\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunityEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?
